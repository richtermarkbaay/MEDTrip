Here&#8217;s a bit more about some of the new features, which you can also find on the about page in your dashboard after you upgrade.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://wordpress.org/images/core/3.6/twentythirteen.png" width="300" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>new Twenty Thirteen theme</strong> inspired by modern art puts focus on your content with a colorful, single-column design made for media-rich blogging.</li>\n<li><strong>Revamped Revisions</strong> save every change and the new interface allows you to scroll easily through changes to see line-by-line who changed what and when.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking</strong> and <strong>Augmented Autosave</strong> will especially be a boon to sites where more than a single author is working on a post. Each author now has their own autosave stream, which stores things locally as well as on the server (so much harder to lose something) and there&#8217;s an interface for taking over editing of a post, as demonstrated beautifully by our bearded buddies in the video above.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in HTML5 media player</strong> for native audio and video embeds with no reliance on external services.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Menu Editor</strong> is now much easier to understand and use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A new audio/video API gives you access to metadata like ID3 tags.</li>\n<li>You can now choose HTML5 markup for things like comment and search forms, and comment lists.</li>\n<li>Better filters for how revisions work, so you can store a different amount of history for different post types.</li>\n<li>Tons more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6">listed on the Codex</a>, and of course you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.6">browse the over 700 closed tickets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Band</h3>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href="http://geekreprieve.com/">Aaron Campbell</a>, and included contributions from the following fine folks. Pull up some Oscar Peterson on your music service of choice, or vinyl if you have it, and check out some of their profiles:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/technosailor">Aaron Brazell</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I&#8217;m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you.

We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities.

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 01:29:53 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 21:49:34 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130812061225";}', 'no');

one of the slides for Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s state of the WordPress Presentation at WordCamp San Francisco, there was a concept screenshot of the post writing panel. Some of those concepts can be <a href="http://melchoyce.com/wpadmin-ui/content-editing.html" title="http://melchoyce.com/wpadmin-ui/content-editing.html">viewed here </a> with the discussion surrounding those designs <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/">found on the WordPress UI blog</a>. <span id="more-8379"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_8380" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ContentEditingProposal.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ContentEditingProposal.png?resize=500%2C402" alt="ContentEditingProposal" class="size-large wp-image-8380" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Proposal To Revamp The Post Writing/Editing Interface</p></div>\n<p>There are a number of reasons I&#8217;m excited to see all of this transpire. For starters, the WordPress community is finally getting the chance to reshape the direction of the User Interface. That&#8217;s not to say that developers couldn&#8217;t do that before but by using the P2 site, the commenting section along with being its own separate team, it just seems more inviting to participate versus everything transpiring on core and trac. Also, as far as I can tell,<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/" title="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/"> WordPress 2.7 &#8220;Coltrane&#8221;</a> was the last time the post writing/editing panel received any attention.</p>\n<p>The post writing screen is my home away from home. It&#8217;s where I spend the majority of my day writing, editing, and managing content. WordPress 2.7 was neat because it added widget functionality all across the board from the dashboard to the post writing screen. Just drag and drop boxes, arranging them in the places that made the most sense for my workflow. I&#8217;m a huge fan of things being modular but the more time I spend within the <strong>Add New Post</strong> screen, the more I want to see widgets disappear and have everything be either 0 or 1 click away. I use a 20 inch monitor and I&#8217;m wearing out my scroll wheel to view the categories widget in the sidebar or one of the widgets I have below the editor. This had me thinking about whether anyone had developed a plugin or alternative editing interface that combined the most used widgets into tabs. For example, the editor already has the <strong>Visual</strong> and <strong>Text</strong> tabs. How hard would it be to add the <strong>Categories</strong> as well as the <strong>Tags</strong> widgets as tabs? I thought it would be a good idea but then I came across the proposed editor by Mel Choyce and hers is so much better than I imagined. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TagsAndCategories.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TagsAndCategories.jpg?resize=463%2C42" alt="TagsAndCategories" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8386" /></a></p>\n<p>The most exciting change for me in her redesign is placing the Categories and Tags widget to the bottom border of the post editor. No more having to scroll around. They&#8217;re also in a position that matches my work flow. I generally write <strong>Post Title, Content, Tag it, then Categorize it</strong>. Considering those things are at the bottom of the editor, as well as the Publish button, I&#8217;m loving the looks of this interface already. I&#8217;m also a big fan of the publish button having its own spot versus being tied in with a widget or hidden in a box of options. While it&#8217;s being discussed, I would love to see the need for a Visual/Text tab to disappear. Instead, create the best of both worlds. Not sure if split-screen would be the best approach but I&#8217;d like to add code to one side and see the results as they&#8217;ll be seen by the public on the other while being able to use keyboard shortcuts in the live preview area as I can in the visual editor. Unfortunately, I think I&#8217;ll have to use a plugin to achieve this as I&#8217;m pretty sure this won&#8217;t be coming down the pike any time soon.</p>\n<p>As for the content blocks, I&#8217;m not sure I can form an opinion on their use until after I&#8217;ve had a chance to use them in practice. In theory, it sounds like a good idea where each piece of content is a lego block and these content blocks are just other legos you can build on top of one another. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/contentblocks.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/contentblocks.jpg?resize=278%2C359" alt="Content Blocks" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8385" /></a></p>\n<p>The idea to format text after it&#8217;s been highlighted is excellent. The text needs to be highlighted anyways in order to apply formatting so this process enables the formatting bar to get out-of-the-way. Less buttons to see as I&#8217;m writing content. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EditHighlightedText.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EditHighlightedText.jpg?resize=454%2C128" alt="Editing Highlighted Text" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8384" /></a></p>\n<h2>Get Involved:</h2>\n<p>You are highly encouraged to participate in the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/">conversation on the P2 site</a> where these mockups are located. Overall, I wish I could use Mel&#8217;s first concept image as my Add New Post Screen right now!

Tell me and the audience who you are what it is you&#8217;ve been up to lately?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is David Peralty, and I&#8217;m a recovering blogaholic&#8230; The basic summary of who I am, that&#8217;s relevant here, is that I have been using WordPress since 0.72, was a full-time blogger for five years and created a lot of content about WordPress. Some of you might remember me from the WordPress Podcast or WordPress Weekly.<br />\nLately, I have been working for <a title="http://www.rocketgenius.com/" href="http://www.rocketgenius.com/">Rocketgenius</a>, doing this and that for their Gravity Forms project. I&#8217;m currently focused on helping with some basic marketing, tech support and working on a documentation refresh that will also eventually include screencasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you join the WPTavern forum way back in 2009?</strong></p>\n<p>I had already started losing touch with the WordPress community back in 2009. Things were changing in my career that stopped me from having the time to research and keep up to date with what was happening and who the key players were, and I really disliked that change.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been very passionate about WordPress, and when I started reading the content on WPTavern, I was excited. Here was someone who didn&#8217;t have an agenda. You weren&#8217;t trying to promote your own company, or be sensational just to build traffic. The forums quickly became a place where the &#8220;<em>best of the best</em>&#8221; congregated, and while I never really felt like part of that group, I watched everything happening.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the WPTavern community help you progress with WordPress in the past 4 years?</strong></p>\n<p>It kept me in the loop. It gave me a place that I knew I could come back to. I recognized a lot of names, and felt like it was a group of people who might just remember some of the contributions I made to the WordPress world. I didn&#8217;t realize it until I was out of the loop how much I would miss the interactions and community.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long after I joined that I started working for the government and then a private company, both of which were using WordPress, and so having knowledge of powerful plugins and upcoming developments kept me seeming fresh and useful to those organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>When co-hosting WordPress Weekly, you couldn&#8217;t stop reading the ad copy for GravityForms. Tell us the story of how you became a RocketGenius employee.</strong></p>\n<p>In January of 2012, I went to Cuba with my roommate and his friends. The trip was wonderful, and it wasn&#8217;t too expensive. Upon returning to work, I was brought into a meeting with the company I was working for. They let me know that they had made some business mistakes and that they were going to have to cut their staff in half if they were to survive. I was brought on board a year before that to help them with IT, web development and online marketing, but by the time of the meeting, I had optimized all three. For a staff of 30, I was barely kept busy. With a staff of 15, I was no longer needed. Initially, they told me that I had until the fall of 2012 to find a new job, but two weeks later, I was told that April would be my last month.</p>\n<p>Immediately, I was sent into a panic. I e-mailed some people who I knew had strong business connections, as well as some people who ran businesses. I asked if any of them knew of anyone looking to hire. One of those people who I e-mailed was Carl Hancock of Rocketgenius.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8375" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-09-at-2.57.31-PM.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-09-at-2.57.31-PM.png?resize=500%2C302" alt="David Peralty Checking Out Gravity Forms" class="size-large wp-image-8375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Gets His First Look At GravityForms</p></div>\n<p>He asked me to send him my résumé and that he&#8217;d pass it around. I had met Carl at WordCamp Chicago 2009 where I got to demo Gravity Forms for the first time. Since that point, I had become one of their biggest fans, as you know. I wrote about it and mentioned it anywhere I could because I saw Gravity Forms as the first application that was connected to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Carl contacted me back and offered me a job. They weren&#8217;t really looking to hire anyone, but they felt a connection to me, and my skills were enough that I could be useful to their organization. I&#8217;ve been with them for a little over a year now, and I&#8217;m even more of a fan of their product than I was before. Mostly because in working on the support side of things for the majority of the last year, I&#8217;ve learned more about how flexible and powerful it can be. I also have to say that support is rough.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been writing about WordPress far longer than I have. Taking a moment to reflect, what are some of your general observations of the project?</strong></p>\n<p>The race to supporting the least tech savvy user has always been a bit of a complaint of mine. I liked that it required some technical acumen to install, update and manage. I miss the days where I had to find ways to update hundreds of blogs using a bash script and reading through the logs it generated.</p>\n<p>But the project never would have been as successful under my leadership, and so I&#8217;m glad that it didn&#8217;t fall on me. I think that WordPress&#8217; legacy code is currently its biggest potential downfall, and I hope they take the advice of some people smarter than I and look at releasing two branches for a year or two, one that supports legacy code and one that is a more modern rewrite. I know Matt himself would love to be involved in that. Build an application framework instead of trying to extend blogging software that probably still has some backwards compatible code from ten years ago hidden in it.</p>\n<p>Like other pieces of software before them, the &#8220;world&#8221; is now theirs to lose. Some small upstart could become the new popular publishing system in the next 2-5 years if WordPress doesn&#8217;t continue to evolve to meet the needs of consumers, designers and developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Back in the WordPress Weekly days, you were my cynical half. Has that changed at all?</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest, I played it up a bit for the audience. Being the devil&#8217;s advocate meant that we could discuss things in more detail, and try to see things from all sides. I&#8217;ll admit that I still don&#8217;t like every move the project makes, and I have my more cynical moments, but I don&#8217;t think there are many people who are as big of a fan of WordPress as I am and I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has ever submitted a line of code, or used the software. If WordPress had failed, my career would have been and would currently be, entirely different.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9k7bb_wordcamp-chicago-walkaround-short_tech" target="_blank">WordCamp Chicago Walkaround Short</a> <i>by <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/jacobsantos" target="_blank">jacobsantos</a></i></div>\n<p><strong>Will you be attending any WordCamps in the near future?</strong><br />\nI would like to. I am thinking of attending WordCamp Toronto this October. Beyond that, I&#8217;ll probably start looking at the mid 2014 schedule for the eastern seaboard of the U.S. as it starts coming out. Ideally, next year I&#8217;ll try to attend two or three, but I&#8217;m getting married in April 2014, and I want to dedicate my financial resources towards making that a nice event.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything you’d like to say to the general WordPress Community?</strong></p>\n<p>The WordPress community is so vast, and there are so many spectacular people in it, but please try to find and remember the people who helped build the software and community it is today. My biggest hope, since falling into the background, has been to have mattered. That my contribution had an effect.</p>\n<p>Oh, and can someone explain to me why there still isn&#8217;t an interface for Custom Post Types as a core element in WordPress? Custom Post Types and Taxonomies are still so confusing to me. I don&#8217;t know why. I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m an old man and just can&#8217;t wrap my brain around these new fangled features.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/OOq7ox_npy4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 09 Aug 2013 19:20:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WP Android: Improved Categories Experience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=876";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://android.wordpress.org/2013/08/09/improved-categories-experience/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1420:"<p>Today, we released an update to WordPress for Android that adds some nifty improvements to selecting and adding categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Removing categories:</strong> you can remove individual categories from a post instead of being forced to clear them out all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorted categories:</strong> the category selection view is properly sorted by sub categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding categories:</strong> a new category will be properly inserted in the category list instead of at the bottom &#8212; and will be selected by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the new UI:</p>\n\n<a href="http://android.wordpress.org/2013/08/09/improved-categories-experience/categories-edit-post/" title="categories-edit-post"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://android.wordpress.org/2013/08/09/improved-categories-experience/categories-select/" title="categories-select"><img /></a>\n\n<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re getting closer to releasing some big updates, including Media Library support, better Account Setup, and a native WordPress.com Reader.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts on the new categories experience?

Collections is a beautiful theme that puts all of the focus on the content. I&#8217;m used to seeing themes with a left or right sidebar with widgets in the footer but this theme doesn&#8217;t have those. This theme artfully showcases what&#8217;s possible with using Post Formats. I reached out to The Theme Foundry to see if they could answer a few questions regarding how this theme was conceptualized and built. <span id="more-8360"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8363" alt="Collections Theme Logo" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme1.jpg?resize=245%2C129" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Who came up with the initial concept for Collections?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> Believe it or not, we&#8217;ve been working on this theme on and off for two years. Back in 2011, when I first saw the <a title="https://www.icloud.com/" href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud website</a>, I wanted to build a theme with big bold elements to represent post formats. I also wanted it to have that real-time &#8220;application like&#8221; feel. I felt combining these two elements would make for a really special theme.</p>\n<p>Around that time, I reached out to <a title="http://veerle.duoh.com/" href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a>. I knew she would be an awesome fit for this project. She&#8217;s an amazing designer with world-class illustration skills. Her unique talent and vision really brought this theme to life.</p>\n<p>We actually started in quite a different direction initially. You can see some of the concepts in the <a title="http://dribbble.com/veerlepieters/projects/35773-The-Theme-Foundry" href="http://dribbble.com/veerlepieters/projects/35773-The-Theme-Foundry">project Veerle posted over on Dribbble</a>. We eventually scrapped the lighter vintage look and went with something darker and bolder. We just didn&#8217;t feel the vintage look was taking it far enough. Scott was instrumental in working with Veerle on the new darker concept, helping her polish the concept into some final mockups.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8364" alt="CollectionsTheme 2" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme2.jpg?resize=500%2C264" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Can you provide more background information into the use of BackboneJS to power the theme versus more traditional methods?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zack:</strong> From the outset, the goal was to give Collections a &#8220;desktop&#8221; application feel. We wanted fast and smooth page transitions. Using traditional techniques of building pages on the server and pushing them to the browser is inherently slow. <a title="http://backbonejs.org/" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> allows you to make a request for JSON data to the server, then render parts of the page using that data along with Javascript templates. This avoids the overhead of loading all of a page&#8217;s assets (e.g., JavaScript files, CSS files, images, etc.), re-painting the page with CSS, and loading boilerplate HTML. You get a nice speed bump with this process.</p>\n<p>Backbone is not the only library or framework that provides this functionality. There are a host of other options out there, including <a title="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax" href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">PJAX</a>, <a title="http://emberjs.com/" href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, and <a title="http://angularjs.org/" href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. So why did we choose Backbone? First of all, Backbone is really flexible. It is a library that lacks a strong opinion. Actually building a theme like this requires mapping a server side application onto a client side application, which we knew would present a number of issues. We wanted a library that would be flexible enough to handle the WordPress requirement, and fortunately, Backbone provided that. Second, because it was included with WordPress 3.5, it is likely that Backbone will become the de facto standard for JavaScript apps within WordPress. By using Backbone, we will benefit from future improvements pushed by WordPress core, as well as benefit from the community that springs up around the technology. In essence, this means that we will be able to build better products for our customers.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, there are no left or right sidebars. Just content with comments. Was that the whole point of this theme or was that a conscious decision not to include those?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> Widgets were never in the plans for this theme. Collections is built for sharing and browsing. It had to be visually stunning and unique. It had to feel like an application, not a website. Making a strong decision like this allowed us to focus on achieving that goal<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Did the decision to yank out the Post Format UI have any consequences on the design of this theme?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> It was a big deal for us when the Post Format UI was pulled out of core. We were timing this theme to take advantage of the new UI, and believed it would be a great example of Post Formats. The sudden lack of a Post Format UI also made things much more difficult from a development standpoint.</p>\n<p>With that being said, it didn&#8217;t impact or change the design at all. We had a strong vision and we&#8217;re determined to make it work with WordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you surprised at all by the large positive reaction to the design of this theme?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> Every time we reviewed Collections as a team, we were struck by it, even after working on it for a long time. If you&#8217;ve been building themes for awhile, you know this sort of thing is rare. You&#8217;re usually sick of looking at a theme by the time you release it. Collections really felt special, but you never know how something will be received. We&#8217;re glad other people in the community feel the same way.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme3.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8365" alt="CollectionTheme3" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme3.jpg?resize=500%2C339" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>One of the features of this theme is special media handling. What&#8217;s so special about it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Veerle designed Collections to highlight the content of a post format. Instead of lumping all of the content together, Collections aims to highlight the special post format content (e.g., a video in a video post). To do this, we needed to extract the special post format content from the actual content. We used some of the functions that were removed from WordPress core, and added our own techniques for grabbing the content. These techniques make it easier to display the content in a beautiful way (see the <a title="http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/collections-theme/type/audio/" href="http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/collections-theme/type/audio/">audio post format</a>). We also leveraged the new audio ID3 tag support included in WordPress 3.6. If you upload an audio file with artist, song, and cover image information, that is used to display the audio. We are really excited about this!</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you can hint us to what&#8217;s coming down the pike?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> I can&#8217;t share anything specific, but we&#8217;re really excited about the Backbone stuff we explored with this theme. We&#8217;d like to continue down that path and see how we can start using these approaches in all our new themes.</p>\n<p>Other than that, we&#8217;re going to stick to our knitting. We&#8217;re focused on taking the time and effort to design and build truly premium quality WordPress themes. We&#8217;ve always valued quality over quantity, and that isn&#8217;t changing anytime soon.</p>\n<h2>Want A Copy Of Collections?</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to The Theme Foundry team for answering my questions.

In a nutshell, Ajax Edit Comments gave registered and anonymous users the opportunity to edit their own comments within a specific amount of time. The idea was inspired by Digg. Despite the vast array of configuration options AEC provided, Ronald has released a new, simplified version of the same plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a>. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8337" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing1.jpg?resize=500%2C186" alt="Simple Comment Editing 1" class="size-large wp-image-8337" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Timer Showing Time Left To Edit Comment</p></div>\n<div id="attachment_8338" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing2.jpg?resize=500%2C347" alt="Simple Comment Editing 2" class="size-large wp-image-8338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Comment Editing Interface</p></div>\n<p>With Simple Comment Editing, Ronald has taken a new approach with the WordPress mantra of &#8220;<strong>Decisions, not options</strong>&#8220;. That&#8217;s why if you look around the back-end of WordPress for a link to configure the plugin, you won&#8217;t find it. This plugin contains no styles, performs comment editing inline, and defaults to a time limit of 5 minutes. However, for those that want to override some of the defaults, there are filters for that. </p>\n<p>In my initial testing, the plugin performed flawlessly. It&#8217;s much quicker to edit comments inline versus the thickbox popup, it&#8217;s also easier on the eyes. I&#8217;m now torn between using this plugin or the full featured AEC which has some nice features such as <strong>Request Comment Deletion</strong> and a built-in spell checker via <strong>After The Deadline</strong>. While I sometimes hate the decisions, not options line of thinking, it works well in this instance. </p>\n<p>So I renew my plea to all WordPress sites that enable commenting to please enable comment editing for anonymous users via the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a> plugin or by some other means. I know comments should be proof-read before hitting the publish button but that happens less than it should. It&#8217;s incredibly annoying to hit the publish button, find one typo and have no recourse.

were playing a game of Family Feud and they asked the question, What word comes to mind when you hear about WordPress and Spam? I bet Akismet would be the top answer. However, Akismet is not for everyone. There are alternatives and today, I&#8217;m happy to report that one of those alternatives has a <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/">fresh new plugin for WordPress</a> built from the ground up. The service is called <a href="http://mollom.com" title="http://mollom.com">Mollom</a>. Mollom is a service managed by Acquia, a commercial open source software company providing products, services, and technical support for the open source Drupal social publishing system.</p>\n<p>The service works in a similar fashion to Akismet in that it scans messages such as comments and determines one of three things. The message is bad, the message is good or sometimes, Mollom is unsure. When Mollom is unsure of a message, it presents a CAPTCHA to the user and if they pass, the comment gets pushed into the moderation queue, if they fail, the message is automatically deleted. Bryan House of Acquia does a better job of explaining the process. </p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<p>The system is built around the Software As a Service concept meaning you can use it on Drupal, WordPress, and more platforms in the future. However, I think one of the coolest features of Mollom is their <a href="http://mollom.com/moderation" title="http://mollom.com/moderation">Content Moderation Platform</a>. Using their CMP, you can moderate multiple websites on different platforms from a single location. </p>\n<p>While both <a href="http://akismet.com/plans/" title="http://akismet.com/plans/">Akismet</a> and <a href="http://mollom.com/pricing" title="http://mollom.com/pricing">Mollom</a> offer paid/free plans, Mollom&#8217;s plans are a bit more complicated to make sense of because of the additional features their service provides, such as the Content Moderation Platform. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-06-at-4.26.18-PM.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-06-at-4.26.18-PM.png?resize=500%2C95" alt="Mollom Stats" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8329" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to place the WPTavern site on the free Mollom plan and give the service a test run for a week or two. Once the test is over, I&#8217;ll report back my findings. I&#8217;d love to hear from anyone who is either already running Mollom in place of Akismet or will be joining me in testing out the service on their own site. </p>\n<p>By the way, is comment spam

development companies announced big name hires. The first was <a href="http://jaco.by/2013/07/31/i-dont-know-why-you-say-goodbye-i-say-hello/" title="http://jaco.by/2013/07/31/i-dont-know-why-you-say-goodbye-i-say-hello/">John James Jacoby leaving Automattic</a> to join the <a href="http://10up.com/blog/jjj-joins-10up/" title="http://10up.com/blog/jjj-joins-10up/">WordPress development agency 10UP</a>. The second, <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/2013/08/01/wds-welcomes-scott-kingsley-clark/" title="http://webdevstudios.com/2013/08/01/wds-welcomes-scott-kingsley-clark/">is Scott Kingsley Clark who has been hired by WebDevStudios</a> most widely known throughout the WordPress community as the man behind the popular <a href="http://pods.io/" title="http://pods.io/">Pods Framework</a> plugin. If you remember back in 2011, Scott put together a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20" title="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the development of Pods 2.0. While he originally asked for $1,500 he managed to pull in over double that amount with $4,177. I reached out to Scott to not only talk about his new job, but what will be happening to his Pods Plugin. <span id="more-8248"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_8285" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsKickstarter.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsKickstarter.jpg?resize=248%2C300" alt="Pods KIckstarter Campaign" class="size-medium wp-image-8285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Successful Campaign Numbers</p></div>\n<p><strong>First off congratulations on being picked up by WDS, a great group of people. My first question is, can you give everyone an update as to what happened after Pods 2.0 was funded via Kickstarter in 2011. What happened to the money, how it was used and did you really meet the goal the campaign was created for?</strong></p>\n<p>When I took over the Pods project, I had a lot of lofty goals. At the time, I was working from home doing various contracting gigs, but wanted to spend more time on the Pods project to get it to the next step, which was what Pods 2.0 was envisioned to be. Pods hadn&#8217;t received many donations and it wasn&#8217;t covering all the time I was spending on it, but I still put in 110% on it. For 2.0, one of the goals was revamping the UI entirely, nothing left behind. We needed a better field manager, content creation screen, and ensure it all felt like WordPress itself as much as possible.</p>\n<p>There was a few other contributors with me who worked on the project off and on, but what we needed was a professional designer / UI person. We knew the only way to get one was to pay for it, and none of us could afford that sort of investment. I set out to take a few weeks off from my main gigs and commitments to work solely on getting Pods 2.0 out the door.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I planned it out all wrong. I started as soon as the Kickstarter made its goal, I didn&#8217;t ask for enough cash to cover my time and the designer&#8217;s time, the Amazon/Kickstarter fees took a chunk out, and I had to wait a few weeks after the Kickstarter completed to get the money into my bank account. I found a designer but everyone was busy and couldn&#8217;t start anytime soon. I waited around for a few, but found that they couldn&#8217;t commit enough time to the project to get it to where we needed it in that short of a timeline. Instead of waiting for the right people and paying once, I hopped around a few and paid for the bits of work each did, but nothing concrete came out of it all.</p>\n<p>By then it was too late, it was now approaching 2012, I was running out of steam to be able to carry it all on my shoulders again, and all my gigs that brought bread to the table began to pile up and need my attention again. I contacted Matt Mullenweg to get his input on how to grow the project and get more people involved. He was pretty busy, but when he followed up a few weeks later, he was very interested in helping me get back on track. He asked what we needed, I explained that I had been paying people out-of-pocket over time, and even had some developers helping pick up the slack working on monthly installments.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CreateNewPods.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CreateNewPods.jpg?resize=500%2C239" alt="Create New Pods" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8286" /></a></p>\n<p>Matt came up with a sponsorship arrangement that took care of the future ongoing costs to get things back on track. And just like that, Matt and Automattic had swooped in and saved the day. Over the next few months we were committing code left and right, I was speaking at WordCamp San Francisco about what I had learned about content types in WordPress, and we had a beta out shortly after.</p>\n<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve continued development and have focused on a number of big features for Pods 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. We&#8217;re currently in development with 2.4 now, with no plans to stop, and we&#8217;re steadily growing our contributor list. We recently launched our <a href="http://pods.io/" title="http://pods.io/">new site</a> with a huge docs section to help make it easier for people to get started with Pods.</p>\n<p><strong>During the campaign you had one pledge of $1,000 or more which is the highest pledge available. The reward was to have a feature built into Pods that wasn&#8217;t already on the road map for 2.0. Can you tell us what that feature ended up being?</strong></p>\n<p>That was pledged by one of my favorite clients, Gina and Anthony Nieves with MarkNet Group (<a href="http://marknetgroup.com/" title="http://marknetgroup.com/">http://marknetgroup.com/</a>), who graciously didn&#8217;t want anything new, they just wanted to help us continue the project and get Pods 2.0 out the door. I still to this day consider Gina a mentor whom I owe a lot to. I hope one day I can pay it all forward to someone else in a similar situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you primarily made a living strictly from Pods development or have you worked with companies over the years as a consultant? Why the decision to work for one WordPress development agency?</strong></p>\n<p>In the beginning, Pods never really got many donations, even before I took over. We still don&#8217;t get that many donations unfortunately, but Automattic&#8217;s sponsorship helps us keep things gliding forward swiftly and covers our time spent on support and code.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with a number of companies over the years while developing for Pods, each one has utilized Pods in some way and some have donated my development time towards the project. I even briefly had a trial run at Automattic but the timing was bad because we had just had our first daughter, I was still working a full-time contracting gig at the same time, and I just couldn&#8217;t give it the 100% that it deserved. I was out on my own from about 2009 to 2011, at which point I jumped back into a full-time gig to get insurance coverage for our growing family.</p>\n<p>After our second daughter Violet was born in June of this year, I felt all of the memories flood back from when I was out on my own and spending more time with our first daughter Annabelle. That, along with buying our first house and my wife having some unfortunate complications postpartum and being unable to take the full load of watching both daughters, we decided it was time to give it a go again.</p>\n<p>This time around, I thought hey, I know some distributed companies are getting really solid now, let me reach out and see if I can find myself the best of both worlds. I contacted Brad and very quickly he responded with enthusiasm. I knew right away after we started talking about how his company operates, the projects it works on, and the team of talented people who I already looked up to, that this was the place for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Now that your officially an employee, fans and users want to know what plans if any do you have for the Pods Framework? Will development continue, will it be rolled into a WebDevStudios product or will development cease for a while?</strong></p>\n<p>Pods isn&#8217;t going away, not any time soon. Automattic has made it possible for us to keep going full force and improve the project unilaterally. We&#8217;re looking for additional contributors to help with support and other areas, but we&#8217;re doing well with what we&#8217;ve got right now. I was able to take some of my income and the sponsorship funds to put one of our primary contributors into an indefinite monthly retainer. He&#8217;s currently helping improve our documentation, helping out with support, and helping fix bugs / triage our GitHub reports. Our next release will introduce Loop Fields functionality and some other cool stuff, keep an eye out for it!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsAutomattic.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsAutomattic.jpg?resize=271%2C93" alt="Pods Automattic" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8287" /></a></p>\n<p>There hasn&#8217;t been any discussion about rolling Pods into WebDevStudios in any way other than integrating it with their existing products and projects. Anything is possible in the future, but nothing will be done without fully understanding how it impacts Pods in the long-term. My goals that I will <strong>NOT</strong> stray from have remained: <strong>Keep Pods free for all, continue making it easier for people to develop with WordPress, and put any/all funds raised by the project back into it</strong>. In fact, I&#8217;ve been known to do contracting work and just tell them to donate it directly to the <a href="http://podsfoundation.org/donate/" title="http://podsfoundation.org/donate/">Pods Foundation</a>, a company I setup which accepts donations and keeps Pods alive for the long-term.</p>\n<h2>How About That</h2>\n<p>I want to thank Scott for candidly opening up regarding the troubles he experienced with planning, scheduling, and the allocation of funds after the successful Kickstarter campaign concluded. Until this interview, I was not aware that Matt Mullenweg had anything to do with supporting Scott and the Pods Framework plugin. Scott found himself between a rock and hard place and I think it&#8217;s awesome that after Scott got in touch with Matt, that he stepped up, came to an agreement with Scott and now the plugin along with development is rolling along nicely. I think Scott will be a nice fit for WebDevStudios. It will be interesting to see a couple of WDS client sites utilizing Pods in interesting ways, if they choose to go that route. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/M2EQD0UVFBk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 23:15:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8.1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=169388";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://buddypress.org/2013/08/buddypress-1-8-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1060:"<p>BuddyPress 1.8.1 is now available.

Since the day I discovered Further, I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how I could make the theme work for WPTavern.com. The things I like most about it is the layout, the logo in the top left corner, the entire left hand column, and the 4-5 widget footer. Further was originally developed by Takashi Irie. Check out his <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2013/03/05/behind-the-design-of-the-further-theme/" title="http://themeshaper.com/2013/03/05/behind-the-design-of-the-further-theme/">behind the scenes post</a> on how the design came to be. Also, take a look around the ThemeShaper website as it was redesigned with Further.</p>\n<p>Some of you may be wondering why the Further theme is not available for purchase on WordPress.com anymore. It&#8217;s officially been retired as it will be offered for free as the default theme in WordPress 3.8. While in San Francisco, I was able to learn that amongst all of the commercial themes available on WordPress.com, Further had the <strong>lowest</strong> refund rate. 2014 will be the first default theme to have a magazine type layout. I reached out to the team dedicated to the 2014 project and Lance Willet had this to say: <span id="more-8240"></span></p>\n<p><strong>What are you folks aiming to do with 2014?</strong></p>\n<p>The Twenty Fourteen team for 3.8 is me (Lance Willett) plus Konstantin Obenland and Takashi Irie. We&#8217;ll put our &#8220;core hats&#8221; on and keep everyone updated via the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">http://make.wordpress.org/core/</a> blog and hold weekly office hours in IRC to coördinate the project; just like Twenty Thirteen development in 3.6.</p>\n<p>With Further as a great starting point, we aim to add a few additional features such as an Authors widget and a Contributors page template. Plus many bug fixes or small improvements as they come up during the 3.8 cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Why the decision to use Further and how different will it look from the Further we see today?</strong></p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg picked it with the primary criteria of &#8220;magazine theme&#8221; with a clean design focused on content and reading. We think it&#8217;s a great fit for a default theme because of its fresh design, great use of post formats, and amazing mobile styles.</p>\n<p>Not much different. Probably most of the changes will be under the hood — improving the code quality and matching core standards better — and better supporting older browsers and adding various accessibility improvements like ensuring proper color contrast.</p>\n<p>That said, any time a theme goes into the crucible of core development, it changes for the better. Looking at each line under a microscope, testing it out in every possible extreme situation. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll all be proud of the result.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people contribute to its development?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing to announce officially yet. The leadership team for 3.8, led by Matt, will be posting to the Make Core P2 soon, hopefully next week. At that time we&#8217;ll lay out the details of IRC office hours, checkpoints for keeping tabs on Twenty Fourteen development, and where people can best jump in and help.</p>\n<p>For now, interested parties can <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Bundled+Theme&summary=~Fourteen&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority" title="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Bundled+Theme&summary=~Fourteen&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority">bookmark this Trac view</a>: to watch the Twenty Fourteen tickets happen.</p>\n<p>Folks can also ping me on Twitter, @<a href="http://twitter.com/simpledream" title="http://twitter.com/simpledream">simpledream</a> — and I&#8217;ll make sure to contact everyone when we&#8217;re ready to dive in.</p>\n<h2>My Feedback On Further</h2>\n<p>While I love the look and feel of Further, there are a couple of things that really turn me off. The first is the use of incredibly large featured images for blog posts. With the type of content this site produces, routinely finding images 600px and wider related to WP would be a challenge. I also don&#8217;t like the pattern image that is shown for posts that don&#8217;t use the featured image. Also, if you use a featured image that doesn&#8217;t fill that area, you see the image plus the pattern which is ugly. This is something that will be addressed in 2014. While the entire site is aligned to the left part of the screen, I can&#8217;t help but feel that the space on the right side of the screen is wasted and could be used for something else, such as a sidebar. However, I think the best use of this space would be to increase the width dedicated to the content section of the site. Also, it would be cool to see the entire site be responsive so that no matter what size screen the page is displayed on, it makes use of all available space. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FurtherFeaturedImages.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FurtherFeaturedImages.jpg?resize=500%2C381" alt="Featured Image In Further" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8275" /></a></p>\n<p>I love how it has pull quotes built-in and the right-hand sidebar takes care of content published with post formats. I&#8217;m excited to see what becomes of 2014 and how the general user base will manipulate the design. What are your thoughts on the use of Further as the default them in WordPress 3.8? What are some ideas or enhancements you would like to see incorporated? </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/UYjnsnT_u5w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 19:45:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin “Power Stacks” – My Shortcodes with Random Text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8096";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/MpM3cwX5Udk/the-daily-plugin-power-stacks-my-shortcodes-with-random-text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9508:"<p>Today I am going to start what I hope is a semi-regularly occurring feature segment of The Daily Plugin series called &#8220;<em>Plugin Power Stacks</em>&#8221; where I will show a &#8220;<em>Trick</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Hack</em>&#8221; for a few plugins that work together to get some added functionality out of your WordPress installation, whether that be in content creation, administration or user interaction. Today&#8217;s installment involves solving the two common problems when dealing with content that changes frequently or is date dependent, even if it&#8217;s just a sentence. <span id="more-8096"></span></p>\n<p>If there are two things that I use frequently in my &#8220;<em>campaign-based</em>&#8221; sites it&#8217;s the ability to create my own shortcodes, and the ability to pull content or keywords at random as if I were to draw a name out of a hat, or as complex as 20 different products that people could buy, with full HTML code cycling at random and embedded with a single shortcode. Here are two plugins that I found to be absolutely <strong>DEADLY</strong> when power stacked together. I know there are many more possibilities and I hope those that read this will share their own 1-2 punch combos that you use as well.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s WordPress Plugin Tag Team of Doom: <strong>Random Text and My Shortcodes.</strong></p>\n<div id="attachment_8174" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/pantsonhead/"><img class=" wp-image-8174  " alt="Wordpress Developer PantsOnHead." src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pantsonhead.jpeg?resize=90%2C90" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a title="PantsOnHead" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/pantsonhead/" target="_blank"><strong>PantsOnHead</strong></a></p></div>\n<p><a title="Random Text WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/randomtext/" target="_blank">Random Text</a> is from a developer named &#8220;PantsOnHead&#8221; from New Zealand. I&#8217;m not kidding. That&#8217;s the man&#8217;s name. But he might want to change that soon, because this plugin is killer and he needs to be recognized! This is one of the more colorful of profile images that I&#8217;ve seen in a while, so I just had to share. This plugin allows you to create random blocks of text or HTML that are called up by shortcode. You can add them based on their own unique category. For example, if I want to add a list of colors that I&#8217;d like to display at random, I can do it in a few different ways.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/randomtext1-bulkinsert.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8262" alt="Random Text Plugin - Bulk Insert" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/randomtext1-bulkinsert.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a>First I can add a list of brands one line at a time and select &#8220;<em>bulk add</em>&#8220;. Bulk add allows you to line delimit your entries and add a massive list all at once. As long as there is a hard-line break in what you are pasting, it will add in mass. This could include full HTML code with embedded images and links, or a full paragraph. It knows when to delimit the import when it detects a return to the next line. Another way to add content is one at a time, allowing for full pages and/or code inserts to come up at random based on a shortcode. I like to consider the categories as <strong>buckets</strong> from which to pull from in future posts.</p>\n<p>Examples of some of the other basic content types I&#8217;ve also loaded into categories could include a &#8220;bucket&#8221; of first names that are gender specific, city names, pet names or even simple banner codes to display. On the more advanced end, you can include fully blown scripts for displaying just about anything you want at random. The shortcode is used by evoking something like [randomtext category="colors"] which would display the item in order of the list, whereas a shortcode callout like [randomtext category="colors" random="1"] would display the same list, but in random order. The real limitations that I found were when I needed to insert random items that needed to be included in quotes, such as alt tags or titles, the plugin had problems getting things lined up exactly as planned.</p>\n<p>With that issue in mind, we now move to a solution in the plugin titled <strong><a title="My Shortcodes" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-shortcodes/" target="_blank">My Shortcodes</a></strong> by <a title="David Cramer WordPress Profile" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/desertsnowman/" target="_blank">David Cramer</a>. This plugin is very complex, and can even be used to <strong>output OTHER PLUGINS</strong> in the Pro version, but more on that later. Though I only used it in a limited way, My Shortcodes allows you to create amazing shortcodes of your own creation. This includes using other shortcodes within it&#8217;s code, which is the solution to our particular problem with Random Text.</p>\n<p>Before I merged this particular plugin with Random Text, I used to use it to help with updating content that was date dependent. The first of every month I simply modify one shortcode that I created to reflect the current month. So in my content, I can simply use something like &#8220;This deal is good throughout the month of [month], [year] and well into [next-month] as well.&#8221; Instead of having to edit a hundred old posts to remain relevant, I can simply change the value of what [month] represents to reflect the current month.</p>\n<p>This plugin is meant to be a fire-breathing dragon right out of the gate. With it you can create custom shortcode elements or even download and install shortcodes made by other My Shortcodes users. It features areas for HTML/text entry, java script input, custom PHP libraries, external/CDN css and java script sources. Talk about loaded with plenty of firepower! You create anything you need in any format, name a shortcode of your own choosing, and it works!</p>\n<p>Returning to the combo with Random Text. What we are now able to do is add the previous shortcode of [randomtext category="colors" random="1"] and just use [color] instead. Nothing fancy there. But imagine when you have proper short codes and random text setup so you can create a fully css integrated panel with a background set to your chosen random color, and a buy button of the same shade. Or even a cycling of images with affiliate links embedded in them that display completely formatted. In my case, I use it in a simple form of &#8220;Choose from top brands like [store-topbrand],&nbsp;[store-topbrand] and&nbsp;[store-topbrand]&#8221; and it would output the top brands at random. If I chose to use an HTML coded link with proper description attributes, I could also use that in the &#8220;top brand&#8221; designator and it would like to the brand pages.</p>\n<p>In the advanced text manipulation end, I use My Shortcodes to embed a sponsor block at the end of my show notes in my music podcast. Every one of the 13 sponsors that I have has random text content, from how I call something a &#8220;coupon&#8221; or &#8220;promo code&#8221; at random to the anchor text that is used to drive traffic to another page on my site. I start on the sentence level, then work to the whole paragraph. What can be randomized and pulled from the &#8220;bucket&#8221; is included as long as it makes sense. I can stuff one shortcode from Random Text into My Shortcodes and go back and forth again. Once the paragraph is finished with all the Random Text shortcodes woven in, I then create a single shortcode for the whole &#8220;block&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Now, when I want to insert the entire sponsor block in my show notes, I simply insert [sponsor1-block] and the entire formatted paragraph is perfectly placed in line. It gets even deeper. If I add each one of my sponsor blocks back into Random Text, I can then create a shortcode that displays only one of my sponsors at a time, at random. Another benefit to this method is that if an affiliate link changes, I simply have to change it in one line in the admin panel and it&#8217;s fixed throughout.</p>\n<p>I know that I cannot do the My Shortcodes proper justice as far as describing its full potential, but I can tell you that it allows me to create a lot of shortcuts for things that I normally would have to create a lot of content for, or around. It allows me to split test on a massive scale, and change things on the back-end with seamless integration. In its most advanced form though, it allows you to create actual plugins from the My Shortcode system, where you can create your own custom plugins based on the data that is output. Very cool indeed.</p>\n<p>If you happen to use either of the plugins suggested today, please consider making a nice contribution to them in any way you can. They have created some really great, functional plugins that completely expand how you think about creating your content.</p>\n<p>I am interested in the feedback of others out there about their own plugin &#8220;stacking&#8221;. Sometimes, just one plugin won&#8217;t get you &#8220;across the bridge&#8221; and you simply need two to get you there. It&#8217;s often tough to think of these power combos until a need arises, so the more we share, the more we learn.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/MpM3cwX5Udk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 17:54:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Matt: Public-Private Surveillance";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42785";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://ma.tt/2013/08/public-private-surveillance/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:205:"<p>Bruce Schneier on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/the-public-private-surveillance-partnership.html">The Public-Private Surveillance Partnership</a>.

We are a bit beyond the halfway point of 2013 and wanted to post an update on what we&#8217;re currently seeing and to show just how true that ominous statement has turned out to be. We also wanted to share what we&#8217;re doing to combat the problem and how you can help. </p>\n<h3>How much (more) spam?</h3>\n<p>We have seen some significant year-over-year increases in the numbers of spam filtered by Akismet. Here is an illustration breaking down the daily averages by month for 2012 and 2013:</p>\n<p><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/graph.png"><img src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/graph.png?w=600" alt="Akismet Daily Spam Averages by Month, 2012 - 2013" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1020" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, successfully combatting over 100 million daily pieces of spam is the new normal. As general spam levels rise, so may the chance that some unwanted items will squeeze through our filters to hit your dashboard and comment queues. This is where we need you to ensure that you mark any such comments as spam so that they&#8217;re reported back to Akismet. This helps our software learn, evolve, and make better decisions moving forward. Because spammers evolve just as often.</p>\n<h3>What kind of spam?</h3>\n<p>All kinds, of course. But if we had to pick a winner so far in 2013, we would probably go with the compliment spammers. There are lots of variations within this category, sure, but the overall tactic remains the same. And unfortunately, we often see that folks are actually recovering comments like this from their spam folders. On this front, <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2007/11/27/it-really-is-spam/">Mark&#8217;s post from 2007</a> is still very relevant and worth a read. Here are some samples of compliment spam, if you&#8217;re curious: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Interesting Findings of the Blog World » Chuck Norris wants a Bible Curriculum in the Public Schools (Gasp!)<br />\n[...] Read the rest of this great post here [...]</p>\n<p>Very interesting&#8230; as always!</p>\n<p>For the most part I agree with you and enjoy reading your posts.</p>\n<p>Hi, you have a jolly good post here, thanks for the good read</p>\n<p>[...] Check it out! While looking through the blogosphere we stumbled on an interesting post today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What should you do?</h3>\n<p>Let Akismet work its magic and correct it only when you need to. If you do, at any given time, experience a small influx of missed spam, there&#8217;s no need to become alarmed. Take a look at the number of comments that Akismet <em><strong>did</strong></em> successfully catch during that same timeframe and examine the accuracy rate (this will help determine whether or not there is a technical problem). Then, of course, mark the comments as spam so that Akismet can process the data. Do <strong>not</strong> place the comments in the trash &#8212; if you find something incredibly out of place, please feel free to <a title="Contact Akismet Support" href="http://akismet.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, always remember that Akismet learns from user feedback via missed spam and false positive reports. This means that, when you see something that Akismet has flagged as spam, know that other bloggers have agreed with its opinion. Have you ever seen those advertisements that claim &#8220;9 out of 10 cats prefer this food!&#8221;? Well, when you notice a comment in your spam folder, think of it as &#8220;9 out of 10 bloggers say this is spam!&#8221; Don&#8217;t get fooled by the bad guys.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, our awesome (and growing) team will continue working magic behind the scenes and ensuring that Akismet is your best weapon against spam.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/995/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/995/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=995&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 13:08:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Anthony";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WordPress.tv: WordCamp San Francisco 2013: Hallway Interviews Track 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21005";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/02/wordcamp-san-francisco-2013-hallway-interviews-track-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:688:"<div id="v-0EcSJgF0-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21005/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21005/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21005&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/02/wordcamp-san-francisco-2013-hallway-interviews-track-4/"><img alt="WordCamp San Francisco 2013: Hallway Interviews Track 4" src="http://videos.videopress.com/0EcSJgF0/video-27a4c1ba6a_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 12:12:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Donncha: Like a dog and his ball";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89498487";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/08/02/like-a-dog-and-his-ball/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2050:"<p><img src="http://ocaoimh.ie/ocaoimh/2013/08/Like-a-dog-and-his-ball.jpg" alt="Like a dog and his ball" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89498488" /></p>\n<p>That there is Oscar, my shih tzu.

It&#8217;s a single plugin that hooks into the power of the WordPress.com cloud to bring you dozens of features for which you&#8217;d normally need dozens of individual plugins: social sharing, robust stats, proofreading tools, extra sidebar widgets, photo galleries and carousels, contact forms, image optimization, and more &#8212; like Gravatar Hovercards.</p>\n<p>Now, when you hover over a commenter&#8217;s Gravatar, you&#8217;ll learn more about them and how to find them in other online spaces:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-453" alt="Hovercard" src="http://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hovercard.png?w=660&h=369" width="660" height="369" /></p>\n<p>Just install Jetpack and make sure the Gravatar Hovercards module is enabled to give your site visitors the tools to create deeper connections.</p>\n<p>(If you&#8217;d like to do even more with Gravatars, the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> has several other well-rated plugins to enhance Gravatars &#8212; we like <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hidpi-gravatars/" target="_blank">HiDPI Gravatar</a>, which uses Javascript to replace standard Gravatar images with retina-ready images.)</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gravatar.wordpress.com/450/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gravatar.wordpress.com/450/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.gravatar.com&blog=1886259&post=450&subd=gravatar&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 04:39:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"michelle w.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"Lorelle on WP: WordPress 3.6 Released – Update Now";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=9936";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-3-6-released-update-now/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:505:"The long awaited WordPress 3.6 is out and ready for download for self-hosted WordPress users.

Each author now has their own autosave stream, which stores things locally as well as on the server (so much harder to lose something) and there&#8217;s an interface for taking over editing of a post, as demonstrated beautifully by our bearded buddies in the video above.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in HTML5 media player</strong> for native audio and video embeds with no reliance on external services.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Menu Editor</strong> is now much easier to understand and use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A new audio/video API gives you access to metadata like ID3 tags.</li>\n<li>You can now choose HTML5 markup for things like comment and search forms, and comment lists.</li>\n<li>Better filters for how revisions work, so you can store a different amount of history for different post types.</li>\n<li>Tons more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6">listed on the Codex</a>, and of course you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.6">browse the over 700 closed tickets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Band</h3>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href="http://geekreprieve.com/">Aaron Campbell</a>, and included contributions from the following fine folks.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img class=" " alt="Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua, Mar 2010" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4037/4435260688_9e4a789d7f.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua<br />Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/4435260688/">Ed Yourdon</a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\r\n\r\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\r\n\r\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\r\n\r\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\r\n\r\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\r\n\r\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself!

When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\r\n\r\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Your personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\r\n\r\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\r\n\r\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\r\n\r\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\r\n\r\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>When you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.  Will you be required to carry them, will they be sent to a local partner, or some other method.  It is important to have all of these questions answered prior to your departure to ensure there are no unexpected complications during your convalescence.\r\n\r\n<strong>Further Resources</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>The best way to make sure you have a good medical tourism experience is to be educated.  Below are more resources that will help you have the best experience possible.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\n\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\n\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\n\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\n\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\n\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\n\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\n\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\n\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\n\n<strong></strong>We think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself', 'What is Medical Tourism?

Sick of the long wait times, high costs, and inferior care available to you locally?  That''s great!  But before you book a flight or hop on a train, there are a few things you''ll want to get sorted out.\n\nLike all medical procedures, medical tourism has risks, so it is important to mitigate these prior to your departure to ensure a comfortable, safe, positive, and healthy experience.  When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\n\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\n\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\n\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\n\n<strong>Safety</strong>\n\n<strong></strong>Your personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\n\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\n\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\n\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\n\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\n\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\n\n<strong></strong>When you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.

Sick of the long wait times, high costs, and inferior care available to you locally?  That''s great!  But before you book a flight or hop on a train, there are a few things you''ll want to get sorted out.\r\n\r\nLike all medical procedures, medical tourism has risks, so it is important to mitigate these prior to your departure to ensure a comfortable, safe, positive, and healthy experience.  When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\r\n\r\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Your personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\r\n\r\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\r\n\r\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\r\n\r\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\r\n\r\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>When you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\r\n\r\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\r\n\r\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\r\n\r\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\r\n\r\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\r\n\r\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>We think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.

Mr. Manzi stated that the medical tourism industry provides $280 million boost to the Costa Rican economy, of which health care comprises $196 million.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\r\n\r\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\r\n\r\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\r\n\r\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\r\n\r\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\r\n\r\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>We think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself!

Employees pay only 10% of the cost of a procedure if they choose to receive their treatment at one of the 19 partner hospitals, while choosing to a nearby medical center may cost them anywhere from 25% to 50% out of pocket.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, PepsiCo began offering the option to travel to Baltimore to receive treatment at Johns Hopkins Medical.

Ms. Trithardt, who needed a tooth replaced, but was unable to afford the $10,000 it would cost in Alberta, was able to have the same procedure in Costa Rica for only $4,000.  This cost includes airfare, treatment, hotel stay, and meals for two weeks.\r\n\r\n“I chose to come here," Ms. Trithardt told Reuters, "because I find in Alberta the prices are about 80 percent higher than in Costa Rica."\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics provided by the Costa Rica tourism institute ICT, there were about 40,000 medical tourists traveling to Costa Rica in 2011.  This is up from 36,000 in 2010, and 30,000 in 2009.  Massimo Manzi, director of Promed, the council for international promotion of medicine in Costa Rica, estimates that 15,000 people, or almost 40% of those traveling to Costa Rica for medical tourism, do so because they are interested in more affordable dental care.  Mr. Manzi stated that the medical tourism industry provides $280 million boost to the Costa Rican economy, of which health care comprises $196 million.  The remainder is a boost to ancillary services, such as hotel accommodations, food purchases, and shopping.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Medical Tourism Booming in Costa Rica', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '39-revision-5', '', '', '2012-12-11 11:40:59', '2012-12-11 11:40:59', '', 39, 'http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/39-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

For centuries - and to today – the world has trekked to India as an eminent destination for healing.  Making India, perhaps, the oldest world-wide healthcare abroad destination.\r\n\r\nLike most of the former British colonized Asian countries, India provides a rich blend of conventional Western, scientific method medicine and traditional holistic healing.   Considered the birthplace of yoga, many vacation to India for its numerous tranquil yoga and meditation spas.  This conglomeration of spas and treatments provides medical tourists an ideal option for post-care recuperation while offering a relaxing get-away for their travel companions.  Ideal for couples and families.\r\n\r\nIndia’s healthcare system is paradoxical - on the one hand, it boasts of ‘best in class’ healthcare delivery attracting medical tourists from across the world, and on the other, it is characterized by a near absence of accessible, affordable quality health services for a large part of its rural population.  India does provide public healthcare facilities but the private healthcare sector provides more capital, better technology, expertise, etc.\r\n\r\nMedical tourism is considered a critical contributor to India’s medical initiatives.  As a result The Indian government advocates medical tourism; they continue to address infrastructure challenges as well as developing compliance and international quality standards and marketing initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe most popular treatments sought in India by medical tourists include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>alternative medicine</li>\r\n	<li>bone-marrow transplant</li>\r\n	<li>cardiac bypass</li>\r\n	<li>eye surgery</li>\r\n	<li>hip replacement</li>\r\n	<li>heart surgery</li>\r\n	<li>hip resurfacing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nQuality of medical care delivered, as of December 2012, there were over 20 JCI Joint Commission International (JCI) Accredited medical centers in India.  (<a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/">http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/</a>)\r\n\r\nEnglish is a common language in India.  Most schools teach in English, perhaps due to the history of British colonization.  Therefore American and English foreigners are less likely to face a language barrier.\r\n\r\nSeveral quality medical universities can be found in India. The most prominent is most likely Harvard Medical. Harvard Medical International formed an alliance with the Indian Medical School in 1997.  Today this is one of the fastest growing Harvard Medical campuses in the world.  In addition, India ranks fourth in the number of students it sends to Harvard U.S, with over 200 attending year. Harvard has about 1,500 alumni in India.\r\n\r\nIndia’s most popular destination for healthcare is Chennai.  It’s often referred to as “India''s Health Capital”.  It’s estimated over 150 international patients visit Chennai every day.  There are many “group” and specialty hospitals, and dentists, across the city.  Chennai attracts about 45 percent of health tourists from abroad arriving in the country and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.  The city has an estimated 12,500 hospital beds.

Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\n\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\n\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\n\nWhen you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\n\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img class=" " alt="Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua, Mar 2010" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4037/4435260688_9e4a789d7f.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua<br />Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/4435260688/">Ed Yourdon</a>[/caption]\n\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\n\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\n\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\n\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\n\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\n\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\n\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\n\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\n\nWe think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself!

A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.

Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\r\n\r\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\r\n\r\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.

When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\r\n\r\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety</strong>\r\n\r\nYour personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\r\n\r\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\r\n\r\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\r\n\r\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\r\n\r\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.  Will you be required to carry them, will they be sent to a local partner, or some other method.  It is important to have all of these questions answered prior to your departure to ensure there are no unexpected complications during your convalescence.\r\n\r\n<strong>Further Resources</strong>\r\n\r\nThe best way to make sure you have a good medical tourism experience is to be educated.  Below are more resources that will help you have the best experience possible.

(<a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/">http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/</a>)\r\n\r\nThis includes Johns Hopkins'' first clinical healthcare facility established outside of the United States, the Johns Hopkins Singapore International Medical Centre.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Singapore''s medical tourists come from neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and patient numbers from Indochina, South Asia, the Middle East and Greater China are growing. Patients from developed countries such as the United States and the UK are also beginning to choose Singapore as their medical travel destination for relatively affordable health care services in a clean cosmopolitan city.\r\n\r\nThe most popular treatments sought in Singapore by medical tourists include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Aesthetic procedures</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Cosmetic surgery</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Dentistry</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Orthopedic surgery</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Eye surgery</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Cardiac surgery</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Stem Cell treatments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to these popular treatments, Singapore has taken a lead in a few specific ares of healthcare including stem cell and women’s cardiac treatment.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, The National University Hospital opened The Women’s Heart Health Clinic.  Its emphasis is on prevention as well as treatment of cardiac disease for women. Women patients are treated by an all-women team comprising a cardiologist, dietitians, therapists and physiotherapists.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1116703/1/.html" target="_blank">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1116703/1/.html</a>\r\n\r\nSince 2001, more than 100 foreign drug makers and biomedical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc., have set up factories here, attracted partly by patent enforcement that''s the strictest in Asia.  These efforts just further Singapore’s intellectual capital and position as the leading healthcare destination of Asia.\r\n\r\nSingapore’s reputation for state-of-the-art equipment and highly qualified surgeons - many of which are U.S. trained - is attractive to Western patients.

For centuries - and to today – the world has trekked to India as an eminent destination for healing.  Making India, perhaps, the oldest world-wide healthcare abroad destination.\r\n\r\nLike most of the former British colonized Asian countries, India provides a rich blend of conventional Western, scientific method medicine and traditional holistic healing.   Considered the birthplace of yoga, many vacation to India for its numerous tranquil yoga and meditation spas.  This conglomeration of spas and treatments provides medical tourists an ideal option for post-care recuperation while offering a relaxing get-away for their travel companions.

India does provide public healthcare facilities but the private healthcare sector provides more capital, better technology, expertise, etc.\r\n\r\nMedical tourism is considered a critical contributor to India’s medical initiatives.  As a result The Indian government advocates medical tourism; they continue to address infrastructure challenges as well as developing compliance and international quality standards and marketing initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe most popular treatments sought in India by medical tourists include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>alternative medicine</li>\r\n	<li>bone-marrow transplant</li>\r\n	<li>cardiac bypass</li>\r\n	<li>eye surgery</li>\r\n	<li>hip replacement</li>\r\n	<li>heart surgery</li>\r\n	<li>hip resurfacing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nQuality of medical care delivered, as of December 2012, there were over 20 JCI Joint Commission International (JCI) Accredited medical centers in India.

The most prominent is most likely Harvard Medical. Harvard Medical International formed an alliance with the Indian Medical School in 1997.

It’s estimated over 150 international patients visit Chennai every day.  There are many “group” and specialty hospitals, and dentists, across the city.  Chennai attracts about 45 percent of health tourists from abroad arriving in the country and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.  The city has an estimated 12,500 hospital beds.

An article in DNA India tells the tale of Anjana, who developed a tumor in her kidney.  Traditionally, the procedure called for would be the removal of the kidney, but in Anjana''s case, she wanted to preserve the kidney, so she traveled to Bangalore to receive a procedure called robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy.  In this procedure, the doctor is assisted by an advanced robotic system, allowing for the excision of only the tumor, and sparing the kidney.  After surgery, Anjana only had to stay three days in hospital, and was able to return to work within two weeks.  Procedures like this have seen Bangalore''s standing as a medical tourism destination rise as patients from the Middle East, Africa, Australia, The Netherlands, Denmark, Russia and Sri Lanka travel to Bangalore to take advantage of this cutting edge technology.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_136" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="size-full wp-image-136" alt="Robot-Assisted Surgery adding to Bangalore’s allure as a Medical Tourism Destination - HealthcareAbroad.com" src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/7341200278_7f752d345a.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> Official U.S. Navy Imagery, 1/7/2013 via Flickr, Creative Commons Attribution[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the field of urology, the ability for robotic assisted surgery in the field of gynecology is also promising.  According to Dr. Gayarthi Karthik, consultant gynecologist at Bangalore''s <a href="http://www.manipalhospitals.com/">Manipal Hospital</a>, "“The robot can be used in removal of fibroids, removal of uterus, hysterectomy, recanalisation of fallopian tubes in patients with blocked tubes or when sterilisation is to be reversed, endometriosis surgery and surgery for cervical and uterine cancers.”  Most gynecological procedures can be assisted-by robots, and it is the opinion of Dr. Karthik that the advances in this field and the availability in Bangalore have boosted Bangalore''s image as a medical tourism destination.\r\n\r\nA final field that is benefitting from the advances in robotics is in cancer treatment.  The robotic assistance allows for much more accurate and targeted application of the radiation treatment, affecting less surrounding tissue.  As Dr. Sridhar P S, consulting radiation oncologist at Healthcare Global, puts it, "Earlier, we faced the problem where we did not achieve accurate radiation. So, if there is a tumor in the lungs, radiation would affect the surrounding areas. However, with the help of robotic radiation, there is little damage done to the surrounding areas."\r\n\r\nThe benefits from a medical tourism perspective are great.  Not only the advancements in procedures available, and the quality of these procedures, but the increased accuracy allows for a smaller surgical site, which leads to reduced recovery times, and more time not stuck in a hospital.  Dr N. K. Venkataramana, vice-chairman and chief neurosurgeon of BGS Global Hospitals said, “Surgeons are increasingly resorting to minimally invasive surgeries wherever possible. The advantages of this technology are minimal damage to tissue and less invasiveness, lesser hospital stay, speedy ambulation of patient, less pain and cosmetically aesthetic with a smaller scar.

Massimo Manzi, director of Promed, the council for international promotion of medicine in Costa Rica, estimates that 15,000 people, or almost 40% of those traveling to Costa Rica for medical tourism, do so because they are interested in more affordable dental care.

The remainder is a boost to ancillary services, such as hotel accommodations, food purchases, and shopping.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Medical Tourism Booming in Costa Rica', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '39-revision-6', '', '', '2012-12-14 14:43:46', '2012-12-14 14:43:46', '', 39, 'http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/39-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Sick of the long wait times, high costs, and inferior care available to you locally?  That''s great!  But before you book a flight or hop on a train, there are a few things you''ll want to get sorted out.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img alt="First Class Health Care in Panama" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2149/2234741663_2d1ef65cf2.jpg" width="500" height="365" /> Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23065375@N05/">ThinkPanama</a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nLike all medical procedures, medical tourism has risks, so it is important to mitigate these prior to your departure to ensure a comfortable, safe, positive, and healthy experience.  When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\r\n\r\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety</strong>\r\n\r\nYour personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\r\n\r\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\r\n\r\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\r\n\r\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\r\n\r\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.  Will you be required to carry them, will they be sent to a local partner, or some other method.  It is important to have all of these questions answered prior to your departure to ensure there are no unexpected complications during your convalescence.\r\n\r\n<strong>Further Resources</strong>\r\n\r\nThe best way to make sure you have a good medical tourism experience is to be educated.  Below are more resources that will help you have the best experience possible.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img class=" " alt="Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua, Mar 2010" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4037/4435260688_9e4a789d7f.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua<br />Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/4435260688/">Ed Yourdon</a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Why would someone do that?</strong>\r\n\r\nProcedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.\r\n\r\nCost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.\r\n\r\nReduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.\r\n\r\nBest-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.\r\n\r\nDiscretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...\r\n\r\nCombination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself!

An article in DNA India tells the tale of Anjana, who developed a tumor in her kidney.  Traditionally, the procedure called for would be the removal of the kidney, but in Anjana''s case, she wanted to preserve the kidney, so she traveled to Bangalore to receive a procedure called robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy.  In this procedure, the doctor is assisted by an advanced robotic system, allowing for the excision of only the tumor, and sparing the kidney.  After surgery, Anjana only had to stay three days in hospital, and was able to return to work within two weeks.  Procedures like this have seen Bangalore''s standing as a medical tourism destination rise as patients from the Middle East, Africa, Australia, The Netherlands, Denmark, Russia and Sri Lanka travel to Bangalore to take advantage of this cutting edge technology.\r\n\r\n<img alt="Robot-Assisted Surgery adding to Bangalore’s allure as a Medical Tourism Destination - HealthcareAbroad.com" src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/7341200278_7f752d345a.jpg" />\r\n\r\nIn addition to the field of urology, the ability for robotic assisted surgery in the field of gynecology is also promising.  According to Dr. Gayarthi Karthik, consultant gynecologist at Bangalore''s <a href="http://www.manipalhospitals.com/">Manipal Hospital</a>, "“The robot can be used in removal of fibroids, removal of uterus, hysterectomy, recanalisation of fallopian tubes in patients with blocked tubes or when sterilisation is to be reversed, endometriosis surgery and surgery for cervical and uterine cancers.”  Most gynecological procedures can be assisted-by robots, and it is the opinion of Dr. Karthik that the advances in this field and the availability in Bangalore have boosted Bangalore''s image as a medical tourism destination.\r\n\r\nA final field that is benefitting from the advances in robotics is in cancer treatment.  The robotic assistance allows for much more accurate and targeted application of the radiation treatment, affecting less surrounding tissue.  As Dr. Sridhar P S, consulting radiation oncologist at Healthcare Global, puts it, "Earlier, we faced the problem where we did not achieve accurate radiation. So, if there is a tumor in the lungs, radiation would affect the surrounding areas. However, with the help of robotic radiation, there is little damage done to the surrounding areas."\r\n\r\nThe benefits from a medical tourism perspective are great.  Not only the advancements in procedures available, and the quality of these procedures, but the increased accuracy allows for a smaller surgical site, which leads to reduced recovery times, and more time not stuck in a hospital.  Dr N. K. Venkataramana, vice-chairman and chief neurosurgeon of BGS Global Hospitals said, “Surgeons are increasingly resorting to minimally invasive surgeries wherever possible. The advantages of this technology are minimal damage to tissue and less invasiveness, lesser hospital stay, speedy ambulation of patient, less pain and cosmetically aesthetic with a smaller scar. Robotics will definitely help to achieve these goals with much more precision."', 'Robot-Assisted Surgery adding to Bangalore''s allure as a Medical Tourism Destination', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '131-revision-23', '', '', '2013-01-10 15:37:55', '2013-01-10 15:37:55', '', 131, 'http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/131-revision-23/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Sick of the long wait times, high costs, and inferior care available to you locally?  That''s great!  But before you book a flight or hop on a train, there are a few things you''ll want to get sorted out.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img alt="First Class Health Care in Panama" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2149/2234741663_2d1ef65cf2.jpg" width="500" height="365" /> Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23065375@N05/">ThinkPanama</a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nLike all medical procedures, medical tourism has risks, so it is important to mitigate these prior to your departure to ensure a comfortable, safe, positive, and healthy experience.  When planning your medical procedure, here are some things to take into account:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training, Accreditations, and Certifications</strong>\r\n\r\nMany clinics, regardless of their location, employ western trained physicians and clinicians.  Make sure to look into the training of the providers at the facilities that you are interested in using for your procedure so that you know what to expect upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specialized certifications and accreditations can be awarded to facilities from outside groups, affirming the quality and authenticity of a facility.  Organizations like <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">Joint Commission </a><a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/" target="_blank">International</a>, <a href="http://www.qha-international.co.uk/" target="_blank">QHA Trent</a>, the <a href="http://www.isqua.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Quality in Health Care</a> and the <a href="http://www.achs.org.au/achs-international/" target="_blank">ACHSI</a> are some of the better known accreditation organizations currently in operation and any facility which meets their standards is of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety</strong>\r\n\r\nYour personal safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance while on any trip, especially with the added complication of a medical procedure.  Even though the likelihood of something happening is remote, it is better to be prepared.  Therefore, before you leave, make sure of a few things:\r\n\r\nTravel Advisories:   Check with you local government or the United States Department of State about any <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html" target="_blank">current travel alerts</a> that may affect your trip.\r\n\r\nInsurance: Check and make sure that your personal insurance covers you while out of the country.  If it doesn''t, invest in travel insurance that will sufficiently cover you should something go wrong while you are traveling.\r\n\r\nTravel Itinerary:  Before you leave, share your itinerary with someone, just in case.  Include contact information for all of your hotels, as well as contact information for the clinic where you will have your procedure done.\r\n\r\nVaccinations and Health Concerns:  Before traveling, talk to your current primary care provider about any vaccines you may need because of the country you are traveling to.  Vaccines should usually be given between 6-8 prior to your departure.  You should also talk to your primary care provider about any health issues that might affect your ability to travel or your recovery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuity of Care</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you schedule your procedure, talk with the provider about how you will receive continued care after returning to your home.  Many clinics may have partners that will be able to provide you with continuity already established.  You should also discuss the manner in which your medical records will be transmitted.  Will you be required to carry them, will they be sent to a local partner, or some other method.  It is important to have all of these questions answered prior to your departure to ensure there are no unexpected complications during your convalescence.\r\n\r\n<strong>Further Resources</strong>\r\n\r\nThe best way to make sure you have a good medical tourism experience is to be educated.  Below are more resources that will help you have the best experience possible.

It is being helped by its stable government and its proximity to the United States and Canada, which supply the majority of Costa Rica''s medical tourists.\r\n\r\nMany, including Alberta, Canada''s Marlene Trithardt, are coming for the potential savings.  Ms. Trithardt, who needed a tooth replaced, but was unable to afford the $10,000 it would cost in Alberta, was able to have the same procedure in Costa Rica for only $4,000.  This cost includes airfare, treatment, hotel stay, and meals for two weeks.\r\n\r\n“I chose to come here," Ms. Trithardt told Reuters, "because I find in Alberta the prices are about 80 percent higher than in Costa Rica."\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics provided by the Costa Rica tourism institute ICT, there were about 40,000 medical tourists traveling to Costa Rica in 2011.  This is up from 36,000 in 2010, and 30,000 in 2009.  Massimo Manzi, director of Promed, the council for international promotion of medicine in Costa Rica, estimates that 15,000 people, or almost 40% of those traveling to Costa Rica for medical tourism, do so because they are interested in more affordable dental care.  Mr. Manzi stated that the medical tourism industry provides $280 million boost to the Costa Rican economy, of which health care comprises $196 million.

This visa can be extended twice, for a total of up to nine consecutive months.  This move looks to unify medical tourism procedures in Dubai, and is a result of recent meetings between the Dubai Health Authority and the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs.  The project is in its beginning stages still, and will still take some time to be fully implemented.  This first phase involves the dissemination of information to qualified hospitals on the procedures that will be required for them to apply for a medical tourism visa on behalf of an overseas patient.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, only hospitals that hold accreditation from <a href="http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/">Joint Commission Internationa</a>l (JCI), or are in the process of obtaining accreditation, will be eligible to apply for the medical tourism visas.  There are 16 hospitals that currently hold this accreditation in Dubai alone, and almost 40 in the United Arab Emirates, although the current visa agreement is only for Dubai.\r\n\r\nIn India, there has been a relaxing of the visa restrictions that have made it difficult for medical tourists to get the proper care.  In 2009, after the Mumbai terror attacks, a restriction requiring a two month gap between visits for people from certain countries was put in place.  These restrictions are now being lifted, and there is hope that medical tourists from the Persian Gulf countries will increase as a result.  The proximity of Chennai, a major medical tourism hub, and the Persian Gulf, is a big draw.\r\n\r\nAbdullah Owais, a citizen of the United Arab Emirates whose father is receiving treatment in Chennai, said, "We are happy to come here as the people are nice and the treatment is world class. This is my second visit and Chennai is only a three-hour flight from there."\r\n\r\nAlthough prior to the lifting of the restriction many procedures were done through medical visas, the new easing allows patients the ability to do a site visit prior to any procedures.  According to cardiologist Dr Ullas Pandurangi, "The easing of visa norms is a welcome move as patients can meet the doctors, go back and discuss the details with their families, and return for the procedure. Earlier, most of these discussions took place over email or through intermediaries.

Usually it involves traveling internationally, but this is not required. Traditionally, medical tourism took place when individuals would travel from a lesser-developed country to receive treatment that was not available in their region.  But in the recent past there has been a growing trend of people traveling from well-developed nations to other countries for medical procedures.</p>\r\n<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img class=" " alt="Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua, Mar 2010" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4037/4435260688_9e4a789d7f.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> Beach umbrella at sunset - Antigua<br />Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/4435260688/">Ed Yourdon</a>[/caption]</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why would someone do that?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Procedure Availability:  There are a number of reasons that an individual may travel for healthcare.  The first reason, as stated above, is that they want or require a procedure that is not available or permitted where they live.  This may be a safe, cutting edge procedure that has not been approved yet by the local medical governing body.  For example, laparascopic banding (lap band surgery) was not approved by the FDA as a treatment until 2001 while Mexico had been performing the procedure since the 1990s.  So you can see how a safe procedure, that eventually was approved by the local governing body, would have been available prior to that time through medical tourism.</p>\r\n<p>Cost Benefits:  Another reason a patient may make use of medical tourism is for the cost saving benefits.  A procedure that costs $50,000 in the United States may be done for under $10,000.  So for an uninsured or under-insured patient the savings, even with travel and accommodations, can be substantial.  Additionally, even fully insured individuals will find that there are many elective procedures that are simply not covered under insurance, and medical tourism will allow these patients to be able to get the procedure they want at an affordable price.</p>\r\n<p>Reduced Waiting Time:  A third reason that someone might choose medical tourism is to gain access to healthcare more rapidly than in their home country.  Many countries, particularly those with nationalized healthcare, can have substantial waiting times for non life-threatening procedures, sometimes up to and exceeding a year.  Sometimes these conditions, while not life-threatening, can seriously degrade one''s quality of life.  In this case, having the ability to go almost immediately and have the problem attended to, rather than suffer for a long period of time, becomes a very attractive option.</p>\r\n<p>Best-of-the-Best:  Sometimes a procedure is available in your home region, but the best doctor in the world isn''t.  For certain patients, having the procedure done by the best possible doctors available is the only acceptable option.  In this case, medical tourism provides them access to that provider no matter where they are in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Discretion:  For some patients, they don''t want the whole world to know that they have had a certain procedure, for whatever reason.  Combining a trip with a medical procedure allows a patient to maintain a certain level of discretion and be able to recover away from the stress and daily grind of their home life.  Imagine someone going away for two weeks and coming back looking ten years younger, they claim it''s just the fresh air and sea breeze, and no one is any the wiser...</p>\r\n<p>Combination Vacation:  For many procedures, the recovery time is minimal, if any is required at all.  These procedures make great excuses to make a vacation out of your medical tour.  A patient can make plans to have their procedure at either the beginning, or end of their trip, and spend the rest of the time on vacation, enjoying the culture and attractions or a new place, while still receiving that important medical procedure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is Medical Tourism Right for Me?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We think that a huge portion of patients could find a use for medical tourism in their lives.  While it won''t be a good fit for all patients, or all procedures, the opportunity to receive better quality care, at a lower price, in an amazing location is simply too good to pass up if the opportunity presents itself!

Employees pay only 10% of the cost of a procedure if they choose to receive their treatment at one of the 19 partner hospitals, while choosing to a nearby medical center may cost them anywhere from 25% to 50% out of pocket.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, PepsiCo began offering the option to travel to Baltimore to receive treatment at Johns Hopkins Medical.  Patients requiring treatments for cardiac problems or complex joint replacement surgeries will have their deductibles and co-insurance waived if they choose to travel for treatment.  They will also be able to have a companion accompany them, and both will travel and stay free of charge.\r\n\r\nAs healthcare costs continue to climb, traveling for healthcare will become a more and more viable option as a way to keep medical bills from skyrocketing as well.', 'Major Employers begin to take notice of Medical Tourism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '25-revision-7', '', '', '2013-01-10 15:39:12', '2013-01-10 15:39:12', '', 25, 'http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/25-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Thanks to this popularity, South Korea has been attracting a slew of medical tourists from neighboring nations—mostly Japan and China—for some time.

For instance, English-speaking travelers in South Korea can dial 1330 at any time of the day or night to reach a bilingual operator who will offer translation assistance or travel information.\r\n\r\nNow, the country is investing in its health-care infrastructure to make medical tourism just as easy.

Prices in South Korea are somewhat higher than in some of the other Southeast Asian destinations, but in many cases, you’re paying for a higher level of service, sparkling cleanliness, and other amenities that can add up to more value.\n\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Several South Korean hospitals are in the process of applying for JCI accreditation to increase their appeal to Western patients. Many of the nation’s doctors have trained in the United States and UK and are fluent in English. The government is working on a program to help train hospital nurses to learn medical English. Many hospitals also have international patient centers and coordinators for foreign patients.<b><b></b></b>\n\nLinks:\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies :\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">South Korea: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/south-korea"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/south-korea</span></a></span></li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in South Korea: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/south-korea"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/south-korea</span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">"The Dong-A Ilbo" ("East Asia Daily"):  <a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://english.donga.com/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://english.donga.com/</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b><b>\nTravel Notes:\n</b></b>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Languages spoken: Korean (official language), but English is widely spoken</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">People: Korean</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Personality: Warm and efficient</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Infrastructure:   First World</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Currency: Won</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Time zone:  GMT+9</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Country phone code:  82</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Electricity:   220V, 60Hz</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Weights and measures:  Metric system</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Elevation concerns:  None</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Climate:  There are four distinct seasons, with cold, dry winters and hot, humid, rainy summers.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Clothing:  Western-style clothing is acceptable.

An American colony from 1898 to 1935, the Philippines have strongly embraced American culture. An official language in the Philippines, English is spoken American-style, with American slang and idioms heavily used.</p>\r\nThe American influence affects the nation’s health-care system as well. For example, many Filipino physicians have received education and training or have practiced in the United States before returning to their homeland. “That makes the Philippines even more ideal as a medical tourism destination for Americans,” says Dr. Constantino Amores, a Filipino who went to the United States in 1963 for medical training. Dr. Amores is clinical director of neuro/ortho/trauma at the Charleston Area Medical Center in West Virginia and also is co-founder of the Mactan Community Hospital in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe country already treats an estimated 150,000 foreign patients each year—most of them Filipinos living abroad who return home for treatment. But “as word-of-mouth grows about the Philippines as a medical tourism destination, more non-Filipino Americans will give it a try,” expects Dr. Amores. Some industry insiders have projected that the Philippines could become one of the top 10 medical tourism destinations in the next five years.\r\n\r\nFor now, the hospitals that are most appealing to medical tourists are located in Manila, the nation’s capital. This vibrant metropolis is teeming with a mix of historic buildings and modern structures. With more than 10 million people living in the Metropolitan Manila area, the hustle and bustle can be overwhelming, especially if you aren’t feeling your best.

Mexico’s mélange of sophisticated cities, inviting beaches, and archeological sites make it an alluring option for the medical traveler. You should be aware, however, that some of the country’s border towns may not possess the same charm as resort areas.\r\n\r\nMexico has one of the highest concentrations of dental clinics in the world. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to determine which clinics are the best and which dentists are the most qualified.

To meet this goal, Malaysian hospitals and health-care providers go out of their way to pamper international patients. Medical tourists who visit Malaysia routinely rave about how friendly and nice the people are. Travelers also appreciate the fact that it’s a hassle-free destination. Transportation is readily available, and it’s very easy to navigate around Malaysia.</p>\r\nThe country’s unique culture is derived from a charming mix of ethnicities, cultures, and customs. In some of Malaysia’s major cities, you may feel comfortingly at home thanks to the Western-style industrial development. Contrasting the modern and sophisticated city structures, serene beaches and national parks offer a peaceful backdrop for your recuperation.\r\n\r\nMany of my clients have been so thrilled with their experience in Malaysia that they’re considering buying second homes there.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia lists 35 hospitals in operation. Many, are managed, or sponsored, by some of the largest American companies. You can find every type of cosmetic, elective, medically necessary, or dental procedure in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Malaysian: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/malaysia#"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/malaysia#</span></a></span></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Malaysia: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/malaysia"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/malaysia</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">The New Straits Times Press:  <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://www.nst.com.my/</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken:</strong> Malay (official language); as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> Malay (the majority group), Chinese, and Indian</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Very warm and friendly</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure:</strong>   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency</strong>:  Malaysian Ringitt (RM)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone</strong>:  GMT+8</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code</strong>: 60</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity</strong>:   220V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns</strong>:  No</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate</strong>:  The climate in Malaysia is tropical.

Indian physicians are world-renowned as highly educated and trained medical providers. Nearly 60,000 Indian physicians practice in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. A growing number of these internationally trained doctors and surgeons are returning to India to treat the influx of medical travelers. With its world-class physicians, high-tech hospitals, and rock-bottom prices, India has emerged as an excellent destination for medical treatment.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, some of India’s thoroughly modern medical facilities are located in close proximity to slums where the nation’s wide-scale poverty is evidenced. This may be disturbing or unsettling and may affect tourists overall experience. Be prepared for hectic traffic and overcrowding in the nation’s largest cities. Although India’s procedure prices may be as low as one-tenth of the cots, hotel prices often are higher than those in other destinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Many of the top hospitals already have earned JCI accreditation, and the vast majority of private hospitals catering to medical tourists have begun the application process. India is especially renowned for cardiac care, joint replacement, and hip resurfacing, but the country is not as well known for cosmetic surgery. One of the central beliefs of Indian culture is “Athithi devo bhava,” which means “guest is God.” This translates into an outstanding level of customer service in the nation’s hospitals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Indian:   <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india</a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in India:   <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">“Times of India”  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: Hindi (official language), about 20 other languages are spoken; as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> India is a veritable cocktail of cultures and ethnic groups</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and inviting</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   Third World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Rupee</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+5</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 91</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   230V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Mountainous in the north</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  The climate varies depending on the geographic region; you’ll find desert conditions in the west, glaciers in the north, and tropical weather in the islands.

One of the central beliefs of Indian culture is “Athithi devo bhava,” which means “guest is God.” This translates into an outstanding level of customer service in the nation’s hospitals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Indian:   <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india</a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in India:   <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">“Times of India”  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: Hindi (official language), about 20 other languages are spoken; as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> India is a veritable cocktail of cultures and ethnic groups</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and inviting</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   Third World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Rupee</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+5</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 91</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   230V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Mountainous in the north</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  The climate varies depending on the geographic region; you’ll find desert conditions in the west, glaciers in the north, and tropical weather in the islands.

By 2012, estimates of one million medical travelers visited Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_353" align="alignnone" width="576"]<img class=" wp-image-353   " alt="Photo: ND Strupler http://www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/ " src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gallery-play_mate888-72157632741927334.jpeg" width="576" height="323" /> Photo: ND Strupler www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/[/caption]\r\n\r\nSingapore Medicine, a multi-agency organization, has been created to help achieve that goal and to improve the nation’s status as an international hub for medical tourism. Singapore also is expected to be a major destination for U.S.-based insurance companies and self-funded employers that begin offering medical tourism as an option to their beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nSingapore is especially attractive to Western medical tourists. With its modern infrastructure and English the most commonly used language, Singapore looks and feels like an American city—only prettier, cleaner, and safer. Because Singapore is one of Asia’s most affluent nations, you won’t come across any of the unsettling signs of poverty that you might find in locations like India, Mexico, or South America. Other pluses include several nonstop flights from the United States to its Changi International Airport and a superb public transportation system that helps keep traffic running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIts world-class treatments come at a significant cost savings compared to U.S. prices. Be aware, however, that the savings aren’t as high as those in many other destinations. For individuals—and certainly for insurance companies—that want to offer medical travel as an option, Singapore’s sophisticated infrastructure, multiple accredited hospitals, internationally trained doctors, stable government, low crime rates, efficiency, and ease of communication make up for the more modest savings.\r\n\r\nSingapore offers treatment in a wide spectrum of medical specialties but is perhaps best known for its advances in cancer treatments, stem-cell transplants, and liver transplants. As of this writing, most American medical travelers visit Singapore in search of cardiology treatments and orthopedic surgeries, such as hip or knee replacements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Singapore provides a first-class health-care system, which ranked first in Asia and sixth worldwide on the World Health Organization’s 2000 report and the highest number of JCI-accredited facilities in Asia. The nation’s hospitals achieve very high success rates, and many of them publish these rates.<b><b></b></b>\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Singapore Abroad: <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore</span></a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Singapore: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">The Straits Times:  <a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.straitstimes.com</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: English is the most commonly spoken language; Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil (official languages)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People</strong>: The diverse population includes people of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Eurasian descent</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality</strong>:   Caring and extremely efficient</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency</strong>:  Singapore dollar (SGD)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone</strong>:  GMT+8</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code</strong>:   65</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity</strong>:  220V to 240V, 50Hz (most hotels provide transformers for appliances that are 110V to 120V, 60Hz)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures</strong>:  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns</strong>:  None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate</strong>:  Singapore boasts a tropical climate</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing</strong>:  Light, cotton clothing is best.

Mexico’s mélange of sophisticated cities, inviting beaches, and archeological sites make it an alluring option for the medical traveler. You should be aware, however, that some of the country’s border towns may not possess the same charm as resort areas.\n\nMexico has one of the highest concentrations of dental clinics in the world. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to determine which clinics are the best and which dentists are the most qualified. For your own peace of mind, we urge you to diligently review, and seek references, identify accredited facilities.\n\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Due to their proximity to the United States, Mexican hospitals have been welcoming U.S. patients for many years. Because of increased interest in medical tourism, these hospitals have taken steps to improve and simplify the medical care process for U.S. and Canadian medical travelers. Many also have started the process of accreditation in an effort to appeal to medical tourists.\n\nLinks:\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Mexican: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/mexico"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/mexico</span></a></span></li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Mexico: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/mexico"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/mexico</span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">BanderasNews:  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.banderasnews.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.banderasnews.com/</span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b><b>\nTravel Notes:\n</b></b>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken:</strong> Spanish (official language), but English is widely spoken</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> Mestizo, Amerindian, and European</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and hospitable</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure:</strong>   First World</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Peso</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT-7</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 52</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   120V, 60Hz</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Some regions of Mexico are at a high altitude, and it may take a few days to become acclimated.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  Average temperatures range from about 77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, although it can get cold at night in areas of higher elevations.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing:</strong>  Casual clothing is acceptable in most areas.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Getting online:</strong>  Fax, Internet, and e-mail services typically are available in all major hotels and in cybercafés.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Visa required:</strong> No</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Immunizations required:</strong> None</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Public health considerations:</strong> Avoid drinking tap water and avoid food from street vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n<b><b>\nCultural Do’s and Don’ts\n</b></b>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Do use “señor” and “señora,” (Mr. and Ms./Mrs.) as a display of respect.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Do learn the name of the Mexican president.</li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Do stand closely to individuals when engaging in conversation (closer than is customary in the United States).

Mexico’s mélange of sophisticated cities, inviting beaches, and archeological sites make it an alluring option for the medical traveler. You should be aware, however, that some of the country’s border towns may not possess the same charm as resort areas.\r\n\r\nMexico has one of the highest concentrations of dental clinics in the world. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to determine which clinics are the best and which dentists are the most qualified. For your own peace of mind, we urge you to diligently review, and seek references, identify accredited facilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Due to their proximity to the United States, Mexican hospitals have been welcoming U.S. patients for many years. Because of increased interest in medical tourism, these hospitals have taken steps to improve and simplify the medical care process for U.S. and Canadian medical travelers. Many also have started the process of accreditation in an effort to appeal to medical tourists.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Mexican: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/mexico"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/mexico</span></a></span></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Mexico: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/mexico"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/mexico</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">BanderasNews:  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.banderasnews.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.banderasnews.com/</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken:</strong> Spanish (official language), but English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> Mestizo, Amerindian, and European</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and hospitable</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure:</strong>   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Peso</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT-7</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 52</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   120V, 60Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Some regions of Mexico are at a high altitude, and it may take a few days to become acclimated.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  Average temperatures range from about 77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, although it can get cold at night in areas of higher elevations.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing:</strong>  Casual clothing is acceptable in most areas.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Getting online:</strong>  Fax, Internet, and e-mail services typically are available in all major hotels and in cybercafés.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Visa required:</strong> No</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Immunizations required:</strong> None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Public health considerations:</strong> Avoid drinking tap water and avoid food from street vendors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nCultural Do’s and Don’ts\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Do use “señor” and “señora,” (Mr. and Ms./Mrs.) as a display of respect.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Do learn the name of the Mexican president.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Do stand closely to individuals when engaging in conversation (closer than is customary in the United States).

Indian physicians are world-renowned as highly educated and trained medical providers. Nearly 60,000 Indian physicians practice in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. A growing number of these internationally trained doctors and surgeons are returning to India to treat the influx of medical travelers. With its world-class physicians, high-tech hospitals, and rock-bottom prices, India has emerged as an excellent destination for medical treatment.\n\nOn the downside, some of India’s thoroughly modern medical facilities are located in close proximity to slums where the nation’s wide-scale poverty is evidenced. This may be disturbing or unsettling and may affect tourists overall experience. Be prepared for hectic traffic and overcrowding in the nation’s largest cities. Although India’s procedure prices may be as low as one-tenth of the cots, hotel prices often are higher than those in other destinations.\n\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Many of the top hospitals already have earned JCI accreditation, and the vast majority of private hospitals catering to medical tourists have begun the application process. India is especially renowned for cardiac care, joint replacement, and hip resurfacing, but the country is not as well known for cosmetic surgery. One of the central beliefs of Indian culture is “Athithi devo bhava,” which means “guest is God.” This translates into an outstanding level of customer service in the nation’s hospitals.\n\n<strong>Links:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Indian:   <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india</a></li>\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in India:   <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india</span></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr">“Times of India”  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b><b>\nTravel Notes:\n</b></b>\n<ul>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: Hindi (official language), about 20 other languages are spoken; as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> India is a veritable cocktail of cultures and ethnic groups</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and inviting</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   Third World</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Rupee</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+5</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 91</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   230V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Mountainous in the north</li>\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  The climate varies depending on the geographic region; you’ll find desert conditions in the west, glaciers in the north, and tropical weather in the islands.

Indian physicians are world-renowned as highly educated and trained medical providers. Nearly 60,000 Indian physicians practice in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. A growing number of these internationally trained doctors and surgeons are returning to India to treat the influx of medical travelers. With its world-class physicians, high-tech hospitals, and rock-bottom prices, India has emerged as an excellent destination for medical treatment.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, some of India’s thoroughly modern medical facilities are located in close proximity to slums where the nation’s wide-scale poverty is evidenced. This may be disturbing or unsettling and may affect tourists overall experience. Be prepared for hectic traffic and overcrowding in the nation’s largest cities. Although India’s procedure prices may be as low as one-tenth of the cots, hotel prices often are higher than those in other destinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Many of the top hospitals already have earned JCI accreditation, and the vast majority of private hospitals catering to medical tourists have begun the application process. India is especially renowned for cardiac care, joint replacement, and hip resurfacing, but the country is not as well known for cosmetic surgery. One of the central beliefs of Indian culture is “Athithi devo bhava,” which means “guest is God.” This translates into an outstanding level of customer service in the nation’s hospitals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Indian:   <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india</a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in India:   <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">“Times of India”  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: Hindi (official language), about 20 other languages are spoken; as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> India is a veritable cocktail of cultures and ethnic groups</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and inviting</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   Third World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Rupee</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+5</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 91</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   230V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Mountainous in the north</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  The climate varies depending on the geographic region; you’ll find desert conditions in the west, glaciers in the north, and tropical weather in the islands.

For instance, English-speaking travelers in South Korea can dial 1330 at any time of the day or night to reach a bilingual operator who will offer translation assistance or travel information.\r\n\r\nNow, the country is investing in its health-care infrastructure to make medical tourism just as easy. Prices in South Korea are somewhat higher than in some of the other Southeast Asian destinations, but in many cases, you’re paying for a higher level of service, sparkling cleanliness, and other amenities that can add up to more value.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Several South Korean hospitals are in the process of applying for JCI accreditation to increase their appeal to Western patients. Many of the nation’s doctors have trained in the United States and UK and are fluent in English. The government is working on a program to help train hospital nurses to learn medical English. Many hospitals also have international patient centers and coordinators for foreign patients.<b><b></b></b>\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies :\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">South Korea: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/south-korea"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/south-korea</span></a></span></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in South Korea: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/south-korea"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/south-korea</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">"The Dong-A Ilbo" ("East Asia Daily"):  <a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://english.donga.com/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://english.donga.com/</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Languages spoken: Korean (official language), but English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">People: Korean</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Personality: Warm and efficient</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Infrastructure:   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Currency: Won</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Time zone:  GMT+9</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Country phone code:  82</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Electricity:   220V, 60Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Weights and measures:  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Elevation concerns:  None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Climate:  There are four distinct seasons, with cold, dry winters and hot, humid, rainy summers.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Clothing:  Western-style clothing is acceptable.

In 2006, more than 550,000 visitors from dozens of countries—including Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Australia, Germany, China, the Philippines, and the United States—sought some form of health are in Singapore. By 2012, estimates of one million medical travelers visited Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_353" align="alignnone" width="576"]<img class=" wp-image-353   " alt="Photo: ND Strupler http://www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/ " src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gallery-play_mate888-72157632741927334.jpeg" width="576" height="323" /> Photo: ND Strupler www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/[/caption]\r\n\r\nSingapore Medicine, a multi-agency organization, has been created to help achieve that goal and to improve the nation’s status as an international hub for medical tourism. Singapore also is expected to be a major destination for U.S.-based insurance companies and self-funded employers that begin offering medical tourism as an option to their beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nSingapore is especially attractive to Western medical tourists. With its modern infrastructure and English the most commonly used language, Singapore looks and feels like an American city—only prettier, cleaner, and safer. Because Singapore is one of Asia’s most affluent nations, you won’t come across any of the unsettling signs of poverty that you might find in locations like India, Mexico, or South America. Other pluses include several nonstop flights from the United States to its Changi International Airport and a superb public transportation system that helps keep traffic running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIts world-class treatments come at a significant cost savings compared to U.S. prices. Be aware, however, that the savings aren’t as high as those in many other destinations. For individuals—and certainly for insurance companies—that want to offer medical travel as an option, Singapore’s sophisticated infrastructure, multiple accredited hospitals, internationally trained doctors, stable government, low crime rates, efficiency, and ease of communication make up for the more modest savings.\r\n\r\nSingapore offers treatment in a wide spectrum of medical specialties but is perhaps best known for its advances in cancer treatments, stem-cell transplants, and liver transplants. As of this writing, most American medical travelers visit Singapore in search of cardiology treatments and orthopedic surgeries, such as hip or knee replacements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Singapore provides a first-class health-care system, which ranked first in Asia and sixth worldwide on the World Health Organization’s 2000 report and the highest number of JCI-accredited facilities in Asia. The nation’s hospitals achieve very high success rates, and many of them publish these rates.<b><b></b></b>\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Singapore Abroad: <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore</span></a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Singapore: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">The Straits Times:  <a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.straitstimes.com</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: English is the most commonly spoken language; Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil (official languages)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People</strong>: The diverse population includes people of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Eurasian descent</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality</strong>:   Caring and extremely efficient</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency</strong>:  Singapore dollar (SGD)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone</strong>:  GMT+8</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code</strong>:   65</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity</strong>:  220V to 240V, 50Hz (most hotels provide transformers for appliances that are 110V to 120V, 60Hz)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures</strong>:  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns</strong>:  None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate</strong>:  Singapore boasts a tropical climate</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing</strong>:  Light, cotton clothing is best.

An American colony from 1898 to 1935, the Philippines have strongly embraced American culture. An official language in the Philippines, English is spoken American-style, with American slang and idioms heavily used.</p>\r\nThe American influence affects the nation’s health-care system as well. For example, many Filipino physicians have received education and training or have practiced in the United States before returning to their homeland. “That makes the Philippines even more ideal as a medical tourism destination for Americans,” says Dr. Constantino Amores, a Filipino who went to the United States in 1963 for medical training. Dr. Amores is clinical director of neuro/ortho/trauma at the Charleston Area Medical Center in West Virginia and also is co-founder of the Mactan Community Hospital in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe country already treats an estimated 150,000 foreign patients each year—most of them Filipinos living abroad who return home for treatment. But “as word-of-mouth grows about the Philippines as a medical tourism destination, more non-Filipino Americans will give it a try,” expects Dr. Amores. Some industry insiders have projected that the Philippines could become one of the top 10 medical tourism destinations in the next five years.\r\n\r\nFor now, the hospitals that are most appealing to medical tourists are located in Manila, the nation’s capital. This vibrant metropolis is teeming with a mix of historic buildings and modern structures. With more than 10 million people living in the Metropolitan Manila area, the hustle and bustle can be overwhelming, especially if you aren’t feeling your best. If you are feeling up to it, you’ll find a wealth of world-class restaurants and exciting nightlife in Manila, which has been called the “city that never sleeps.”\r\n\r\nAnother area in the Philippines expected to be an ideal location for medical tourism is Mactan, a tranquil island within a short drive from Cebu, the nation’s second largest city. This tropical island houses several five-star resorts, an international airport, and a hospital.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Some 1,000 physicians—many of them trained in the United States—treat patients here using cutting-edge equipment. Doctors, nurses, and physical therapists will make “house calls,” visiting international patients in nearby hotels and resorts during the recuperation phase.\r\n<b><b>\r\nLinks:</b></b>\r\n<ul style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Filipino: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/philippines"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/philippines</span></a></span></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Philippines: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/philippines"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/philippines</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Local News </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> (in English)</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">The Philippine Daily Inquirer: <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="http://www.inquirer.net/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">http://www.inquirer.net/</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken:</strong> Pilipino (Tagalog) and English are the official languages</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People</strong>: Tagalog, Chinese, Spanish, and many others</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Caring and compassionate</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure:</strong>   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Philippine peso</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+8</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 63</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>  220V, 60Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  Expect hot and humid weather regardless of the time of year.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing:</strong>  Light, cotton clothing is best.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Getting online:</strong> Fax, Internet, and e-mail services typically are available in all major hotels and in cybercafés.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Visa required:</strong> Yes, if staying more than 21 days</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Immunizations required:</strong> None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Public health considerations:</strong> None</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nCultural Do’s and Don’ts\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Do act, speak, and dress conservatively.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Do negotiate prices when shopping.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Don’t discuss religion and politics.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Don’t show anger.</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Don’t speak loudly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #888888;">INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SITE IS INTENDED AS A GUIDE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.

For your own peace of mind, we urge you to diligently review, and seek references, identify accredited facilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Due to their proximity to the United States, Mexican hospitals have been welcoming U.S. patients for many years. Because of increased interest in medical tourism, these hospitals have taken steps to improve and simplify the medical care process for U.S. and Canadian medical travelers.

To meet this goal, Malaysian hospitals and health-care providers go out of their way to pamper international patients. Medical tourists who visit Malaysia routinely rave about how friendly and nice the people are. Travelers also appreciate the fact that it’s a hassle-free destination. Transportation is readily available, and it’s very easy to navigate around Malaysia.</p>\r\nThe country’s unique culture is derived from a charming mix of ethnicities, cultures, and customs. In some of Malaysia’s major cities, you may feel comfortingly at home thanks to the Western-style industrial development.

Indian physicians are world-renowned as highly educated and trained medical providers. Nearly 60,000 Indian physicians practice in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. A growing number of these internationally trained doctors and surgeons are returning to India to treat the influx of medical travelers. With its world-class physicians, high-tech hospitals, and rock-bottom prices, India has emerged as an excellent destination for medical treatment.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, some of India’s thoroughly modern medical facilities are located in close proximity to slums where the nation’s wide-scale poverty is evidenced. This may be disturbing or unsettling and may affect tourists overall experience. Be prepared for hectic traffic and overcrowding in the nation’s largest cities. Although India’s procedure prices may be as low as one-tenth of the cots, hotel prices often are higher than those in other destinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Many of the top hospitals already have earned JCI accreditation, and the vast majority of private hospitals catering to medical tourists have begun the application process. India is especially renowned for cardiac care, joint replacement, and hip resurfacing, but the country is not as well known for cosmetic surgery. One of the central beliefs of Indian culture is “Athithi devo bhava,” which means “guest is God.” This translates into an outstanding level of customer service in the nation’s hospitals.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Indian:   <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/india</a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in India:   <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/india</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">“Times of India”  <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: Hindi (official language), about 20 other languages are spoken; as a former British colony, English is widely spoken</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People:</strong> India is a veritable cocktail of cultures and ethnic groups</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality:</strong>   Warm and inviting</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   Third World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency:</strong>  Rupee</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone:</strong>  GMT+5</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code:</strong> 91</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity:</strong>   230V to 240V, 50Hz</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures:</strong>  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns:</strong>  Mountainous in the north</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate:</strong>  The climate varies depending on the geographic region; you’ll find desert conditions in the west, glaciers in the north, and tropical weather in the islands.

This cosmopolitan city also is known for its advanced health-care system and highly skilled doctors. In particular, it’s earned a reputation among medical tourists for dentistry and plastic surgery. It’s estimated that 1 in 30 Argentineans have had at least one plastic surgery procedure.\r\n\r\nCosmetic surgery’s popularity in Argentina has sparked a boom in plastic surgery outpatient clinics, with many clinics located in Buenos Aires. If you’re considering traveling to Argentina, be aware that English isn’t commonly spoken, so you may need a translator.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Despite the influx of medical travelers from Europe and the United States, Argentina’s hospitals have not made great strides to earn international accreditation.

In 2006, more than 550,000 visitors from dozens of countries—including Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Australia, Germany, China, the Philippines, and the United States—sought some form of health are in Singapore. By 2012, estimates of one million medical travelers visited Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_353" align="alignnone" width="576"]<img class=" wp-image-353   " alt="Photo: ND Strupler http://www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/ " src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gallery-play_mate888-72157632741927334.jpeg" width="576" height="323" /> Photo: ND Strupler www.flickr.com/photos/strupler/[/caption]\r\n\r\nSingapore Medicine, a multi-agency organization, has been created to help achieve that goal and to improve the nation’s status as an international hub for medical tourism. Singapore also is expected to be a major destination for U.S.-based insurance companies and self-funded employers that begin offering medical tourism as an option to their beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nSingapore is especially attractive to Western medical tourists. With its modern infrastructure and English the most commonly used language, Singapore looks and feels like an American city—only prettier, cleaner, and safer. Because Singapore is one of Asia’s most affluent nations, you won’t come across any of the unsettling signs of poverty that you might find in locations like India, Mexico, or South America. Other pluses include several nonstop flights from the United States to its Changi International Airport and a superb public transportation system that helps keep traffic running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIts world-class treatments come at a significant cost savings compared to U.S. prices. Be aware, however, that the savings aren’t as high as those in many other destinations. For individuals—and certainly for insurance companies—that want to offer medical travel as an option, Singapore’s sophisticated infrastructure, multiple accredited hospitals, internationally trained doctors, stable government, low crime rates, efficiency, and ease of communication make up for the more modest savings.\r\n\r\nSingapore offers treatment in a wide spectrum of medical specialties but is perhaps best known for its advances in cancer treatments, stem-cell transplants, and liver transplants. As of this writing, most American medical travelers visit Singapore in search of cardiology treatments and orthopedic surgeries, such as hip or knee replacements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hospitals:</strong> Singapore provides a first-class health-care system, which ranked first in Asia and sixth worldwide on the World Health Organization’s 2000 report and the highest number of JCI-accredited facilities in Asia. The nation’s hospitals achieve very high success rates, and many of them publish these rates.<b><b></b></b>\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Embassies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Singapore Abroad: <a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/singapore</span></a></li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Foreign in Singapore: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/singapore</span></a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">Local News (in English)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr">The Straits Times:  <a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.straitstimes.com</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b><b>\r\nTravel Notes:\r\n</b></b>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Languages spoken</strong>: English is the most commonly spoken language; Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil (official languages)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>People</strong>: The diverse population includes people of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Eurasian descent</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Personality</strong>:   Caring and extremely efficient</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:   First World</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Currency</strong>:  Singapore dollar (SGD)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Time zone</strong>:  GMT+8</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Country phone code</strong>:   65</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity</strong>:  220V to 240V, 50Hz (most hotels provide transformers for appliances that are 110V to 120V, 60Hz)</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Weights and measures</strong>:  Metric system</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Elevation concerns</strong>:  None</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Climate</strong>:  Singapore boasts a tropical climate</li>\r\n	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Clothing</strong>:  Light, cotton clothing is best.

Denver, Colorado, USA vs. India (Bangalore, Karnataka)\n\nHere are the results:\n\n<b>USA: (Denver, Colorado) </b>\n<ul>\n	<li>Salary Range: 55,000 – 97,000 (USD)                                       Median: 76,038 (USD)</li>\n</ul>\n<b>India: (Bangalore, Karnataka</b>)\n<ul>\n	<li>Salary Range: 330,000 – 1 Million INR (Indian Rupee)          Median: 649,961 (INR)</li>\n</ul>\nWith the Conversion Rate toINR -  USD, the median salary for the position in India is  $11,946.00 (USD). A difference of $64,092 (186%).\n\nThis year''s U.S. forecasted increase of 9% equals $6,843.  The 18% increase forecasted in India equals $2,120.\n\nOf course, I was only interested in understanding what the 18% represents.  I''ll leave it to others to determine what this $2,120 represents to Healthcare Abroad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUS: <a href="http://www.payscale.com/mypayscale.aspx?pid=ad4d271d-ff00-48b3-a377-12c5316c5ca4">http://www.payscale.com/mypayscale.aspx?pid=ad4d271d-ff00-48b3-a377-12c5316c5ca4</a>\n\nIndia: <a href="http://www.payscale.com/mypayscale.aspx?pid=801efee6-6c5a-43f4-9446-3e063b509f7b">http://www.payscale.com/mypayscale.aspx?pid=801efee6-6c5a-43f4-9446-3e063b509f7b</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', '18% of what?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '479-revision-5', '', '', '2013-02-22 08:16:06', '2013-02-22 08:16:06', '', 479, 'http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/479-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Japan and  China are both building the infrastructure to make Medical Tourism a major industry,  and the United Arab Emirates continues to support Medical Tourism, now creating a <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/health/diploma-in-health-economics-to-push-dubai-s-medical-tourism-1.1190022" target="_blank">Diploma in Health Economics </a>in an attempt to drive their Medical Tourism Industry.  Even with all these advances, a leading cardiac expert says that India will maintain its dominance in the field for at least another decade.\r\n\r\nDr. K M Cherian, a world renown heart surgeon, and founding chairman of <a href="http://www.frontierlifeline.com/" target="_blank">Frontier Lifeline Hospital</a>, believes that India''s major benefit comes in the form of its human capital.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_489" align="alignleft" width="295"]<a href="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-03-at-3.27.27-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-489" alt="Photo © http://www.frontierlifeline.com/" src="http://www.healthcareabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-03-at-3.27.27-PM.png" width="295" height="297" /></a> Photo © http://www.frontierlifeline.com/[/caption]\r\n\r\nSpeaking at a conference in Beijing, Dr. Cherian said that, "India''s biggest advantage is the language and human technology which cannot be easily replaced," and other countries, specifically China and Japan, would have difficulties overcoming this barrier."\r\n\r\nHe went on to say, "They cannot do it for the next 10 years. Having equipment and hospitals is not enough. The main problem for them is the language.  They have technology, but human technology is missing. That is where we make a difference. Indian doctors are well accepted all over the world."\r\n\r\nDr. Cherian sees a great opportunity for Indian private hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to well in China as that country opens up to more corporate forms of healthcare.\r\n\r\n"Right now China only has government hospitals. However much they are good, they cannot serve over 1.4 billion people. It is a tremendous strain", he said.  But loosening restrictions may make more affordable healthcare available to the burgeoning Chinese middle class, and create a opportunity for many medical exchanges.\r\n\r\n"My own hospital has trained six Chinese cardiac surgeons" Cherian said, along with encouraging both China and Japan to focus on medical exchanges as a way to increase skills, and help close the human technology gap.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'While Other Countries Clamor to Increase Medical Tourism, an Expert says India will Remain at Top for at Least a Decade', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '488-revision-7', '', '', '2013-06-03 21:32:06', '2013-06-03 21:32:06', '', 488, 'http://hcasite-blog.local/?p=528', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
